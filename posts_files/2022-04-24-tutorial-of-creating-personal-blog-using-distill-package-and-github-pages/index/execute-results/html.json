I suggest readers check it out first.\n\n## Requirement\n\nFollowing software is necessary to replicate the steps in this post:\n\n-   Github account\n-   Rstudio and R\n-   <mark>distill</mark> R package\n\nTo get started with Github, please refer to the [official website](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account). To install *distill* package, run `install.packages(\"distill\")` in your R console.\n\n## Procedure\n\nTo create a website with the URL \\<username.github.io\\>, create the directory name with same name and same Github repo name. For example, my github repo name is \"jihongz.github.io\", and it is published in <http://jihongz.github.io>.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Flowchart for creating website](img/flowchart.png){fig-align='center' width=306}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo have your personal website, you need to have all require files for the website. The basic files for Github Pages based website with distill includes:\n\n1.  \\_site.yml\n2.  index.Rmd\n3.  .nojekyll\n4.  \\_posts\n\n![Example of file structure used in my github website](img/file_structure.png)\n\n## New Post\n\nTo create a new post, use `distill::create_post()` function with the name of the post. The function will create a new directory \"2022-XX-XX-post-name\" in the *\\_posts* folder in which there exists a Rmd file with same name. The Rmd file will be your content of the new post.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndistill::create_post(title = \"Tutorial of creating personal blog using distill package and Github Pages\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n![Files in your post folder](img/Rmd_file.png)\n\nOpen the Rmd file and make sure the header of your Rmd file is like this:\n\n```         \n---\ntitle: \"[Tutorial] Creating Academic Blog\"\ndescription: |\n  This post reviews the procedure of creating Github Pages Website  using distill package and Github Pages in a step-to-step way.\nauthor:\n  - name: Zhang Jihong\n    url: {}\ndate: 2022-04-24\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    self_contained: false\n---\n```\n\nAfter editting the Rmd file, knit the fill and then build website using *Build Website* button in the Build pane of Rstudio.\n\n![The Build button in Rstudio](img/build_website.png)\n\nIt will then pop up your updated website in a window.\n\n![Preview of updated website](img/website_preview.png)\n\nHowever, the website is not published yet. To publish the website, upload the files to Github. Following is a example of pushing the local files to the Github server via command line.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ngit add *\ngit commit -m \"create a new post\"\ngit push\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Settings of Github Repo\n\nGo to the Github Repo \\> Settings \\> Pages\n\n![Github Settings](img/Settings.png)\n\nIn the webpage, choose *\\_docs* and you will see your website is published.\n\n![change settings](img/docs.png)\n\n## Reference\n\nLearn more about using Distill at <https://rstudio.github.io/distill>.\n",
