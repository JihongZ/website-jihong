Introduce ourselves\n\n2.  Go through the syllabus\n\n3.  Introduce R and Rstudio\n\n## Self Introduction\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"33%\"}\n![University of Kansas](figures/school_ku.png){fig-align=\"left\" width=\"73%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"33%\"}\n![University of Iowa](figures/school_ui.png){fig-align=\"left\" width=\"73%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"33%\"}\n![Life in Hong Kong](figures/hongkong_living.jpg){fig-align=\"left\" width=\"75%\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n## It is your turn\n\n-   Tell me:\n\n    1.  Your name\n    2.  Department name\n    3.  Which year in your program\n    4.  Anything else you want to share\n\n## What To Expect This Semester\n\n-   I believe that everyone **is capable** and can **significantly benefit** from learning varied types of multivariate analysis\n\n    -   The hard part is the working memory load, not the math\n\n-   **Philosophy**: Focus on accessibility + learning-by-doing\n\n    -   The AMS class heavily emphasize on hands-on task-oriented practices\n\n    -   **No** anxiety-prone tasks (e.g., hand calculations, memorizing formulas)\n\n    -   **No** anxiety-prone methods of evaluation (e.g., timed tests)\n\n-   **Materials**[^1][^2]**:**\n\n    -   **Lecture** slides present concepts—the **what** and the **why**\n\n    -   **Example** documents: reinforce the concepts and demonstrate the **how** using software—R packages\n\n    -   All available at the [course website](https://jihongzhang.org/posts/Lectures/2024-07-21-applied-multivariate-statistics-esrm64503/) (hosted outside of Blackboard)\n\n        -   [Let me can show you how to use the website]{.underline}\n\n[^1]: Prof. Lesa Hoffman's website: <https://www.lesahoffman.com/PSQF6270/index.html>\n\n[^2]: Prof. Jonathan Templin's EPSY905: <https://jonathantemplin.com/fundamentals-multivariate-modeling-spring-2018-epsy-905/>\n\n## Course Requirements\n\n-   **8 in-class quiz** (16 points): formative assessments aiming for refreshing our memory in last week\n\n    -   An opportunity for you to request topics for further clarification and review\n\n    -   Typically 2-3 questions that can be finished in 15 minutes\n\n-   **4 homework assignments** (HW1-4, 84 points): Practice doing data analysis\n\n    -   Based directly on example given (no googling or ChatGPT needed, ever)\n\n    -   **Homework 1-3**: unique canned dataset\n\n        -   Answered online homework portal\n\n    -   **Homework 4: individual data analysis + written results section**\n\n        -   Get my feedback for using a model of your choice on your data + optional revision\n\n-   **Extra points** (10 points, **HW0**)\n\n    -   I will show you how to use the system using Homework 0 as the example\n\n## Our Other Responsibility\n\n-   My job (besides providing materials and assignments):\n\n    -   **Answer questions** via email, in individual meetings, or in group-based zoom office hours—you can each work on homework during office hours and get immediate assistance (and then keep working)\n\n        -   Email me first\n\n-   Your job (in descending order of timely importance):\n\n    -   **Ask questions**—preferably in class, but any time is better than none\n\n    -   **Frequently review** the class material, focusing on mastering the vocabulary, logic, and procedural skills\n\n    -   Don't wait until the last minute to start homework, and don't be afraid to **ask for help if you get stuck** on one thing for more than 15 minutes\n\n        -   Please email me (jzhang\\@uark.edu) a screenshot of your code+error so I can respond easily\n\n    -   **Practice** using the software to implement the techniques you are learning on **data you care about**\n\n    -   **Do the readings** for a broader perspective and additional example (best after the lecture)\n\n## More About Your Experience in this Class\n\n-   **Attendance**: Strongly recommended but not required\n\n    -   **Please do not attend in-person if you might be sick!**\n\n    -   You can also join the class via Zoom\n\n    -   You won't miss out: I will post **YouTube** recordings (audio + screenshare) by requested at the course website.\n\n-   **Changes** will be sent via email by 9 am on class days\n\n    -   I will update the homework and in-class quiz links on class days. If not uploaded, then there are two situations: (1) I forget to do that. I will re-upload later and notify you by emails. (2) I decide not to upload it or remove it.\n\n    -   I may change to zoom-only for dangerous weather or if I am sick.\n\n## Statistical Software\n\n-   I will show examples primarily using **R and R packages**. Some important R packages include:\n\n    -   **Tidyverse**: a comprehensive R package including multiple mini packages for multiple data cleaning, data transformation.\n\n    -   **ggplot2**: a popular package for data visualization\n\n-   **Why not SPSS?**\n\n    -   SPSS could only be used for some—but not all–of our content\n\n    -   More importantly, it doesn't have as much room to grow; R has many new packages being developed via CRAN and GitHub\n\n-   **Why not SAS?**\n\n    -   SAS is not **open-sourced**, meaning that we cannot check source code if something goes wrong\n\n    -   SAS is also commercial, but R is free\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   **Why not Python, Julia, STAT or other software (e.g., matlab)?**\n\n    -   They are not so popular in the relevant fields of educational statistics, which means you cannot get much support from the community.\n\n    -   But I think Python and Julia are worth learning! If you have Python / Julia code or tips that related to our course, [please share them with me! I will give you extra points]{.underline}\n\n-   **My story**: I am a heavy-duty R user:\n\n    -   I use R for almost everything (like course/conference slides, website building, data analysis, paper writing)\n\n    -   I am also learning Julia and Python but not plan to add them to my classes\n\n    -   I know how to use Mplus but do not use it very often\n\n## Why R?\n\n-   There are some point to consider\n\n    -   R packages are only as good as their authors (so little quality control)\n\n    -   Syntax and capabilities are idiosyncratic to the packages\n\n-   **The good things** are:\n\n    -   If you really master R, you can do by yourself (write your own algorithm for complex model)\n\n    -   You can check the source code of R packages and know where issues come from\n\n    -   You can communicate with R package authors and provide some suggestions\n\n    -   You can be R package author yourself and be famous\n\n## Working with Programs Through Syntax\n\n-   If you feel the class is not so challenging for you, you can see materials for my other class, [ESRM 6553: Advanced Multivariate Analysis](https://jihongzhang.org/posts/Lectures/2024-01-12-syllabus-adv-multivariate-esrm-6553/)\n\n-   I DO NOT need you to memorize syntax\n\n-   Instead, you can do exactly what I (still) do:\n\n    -   **Find the example source file** for what you need to do\n\n    -   Figure out how to **modify it** to work for your homework\n\n    -   Copy (CTRL+C), paste (CTRL+V), and find and replace are your friends\n\n-   Don't hesitate to ask for help (i.e., email me a screenshot)\n\n## What You Are Supposed To Know Already\n\n-   Recommended prerequisite:\n\n    -   ESRM 64103. Experimental Design in Education **or similar classes**\n\n    -   ESRM 64203. Multiple Regression Techniques for Education **or similar classes**\n\n-   **What we will cover this semester:**\n\n    -   Basic usage of R and RStudio (i.e., R download, package installation, package loading)\n\n    -   Descriptive statistics and bivariate associations (e.g., correlation)\n\n    -   **Statistical concepts** (e.g., null hypothesis testing, maximum likelihood estimation)\n\n    -   **Generalized linear models** (i.e., regression, ANOVA, path analysis, factor analysis)\n\n-   This class will focus on **multivariate analysis**... so what is that?\n\n## What are Multivariate Analysis?\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column .nonincremental width=\"50%\"}\n> -   **Multivariate statistics** is a subdivision of statistics encompassing the simultaneous observation and analysis of **more than one outcome variable (Dependent Variables / DVs)**.\n>\n> – Wikipedia\n\n-   Many different multivariate analysis models used multivariate statistics:\n\n    -   Generalized linear regression\n\n    -   Principal components analysis (PCA)\n\n    -   Path analysis\n\n    -   Factor analysis (FA)\n\n    -   Network analysis (NA)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![Word Cloud of MVA wiki](figures/wordcloud.png){fig-align=\"left\" width=\"100%\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n## Why Use Multivariate Statistics\n\nCompared to univariate analysis, **Multivariate Statistics** provides a more thorough picture of the reality.\n\nImagine our theory of depression support following two models:\n\n![](figures/Models.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\n**Note: Not all theoretical models can be estimated via statistics**\n\n## What We Will Cover This Semester\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   **Part I: General linear models**\n    -   Introduction/Descriptive statistics\n    -   Simple, Marginal, Interaction Effects\n    -   Multivariate Linear Models\n    -   Extension: Generalized linear regression\n        -   Predicting non-normal conditional outcomes\n-   **Part II: Statistical techniques**\n    -   Normal Distributions and Multivariate Normal Distribution\n    -   Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)\n    -   Missing Data and Multiple Imputation\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   **Part III: Path Analysis**\n    -   Structural models\n-   **Part IV: Latent variable models**\n    -   Principle component analysis (PCA)\n    -   Exploratory factor analysis (EFA)\n    -   Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)\n    -   Latent class models (LCA) or mixture models\n:::\n:::\n\n## Introduction to R\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   **R** is an comprehensive statistical and graphical programming language\n\n-   We can use **R language** via multiple graphical user inferences or IDE, i.e., terminal, VS Code or RStudio.\n\n    -   We will mainly focus on RStudio because of its convenience\n\n    -   Rstudio is a product of posit company and is free to use for personal use\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n::: panel-tabset\n## Terminal\n\n![](figures/terminal.png){fig-align=\"left\" width=\"100%\"}\n\n## Rstudio\n\n![](figures/Rstudio.png){fig-align=\"left\" width=\"100%\"}\n\n## VSCode\n\n![](figures/VsCode.png){fig-align=\"left\" width=\"100%\"}\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n## More RStudio\n\n![](figures/Rstudio_labelled.png){fig-align=\"left\" width=\"100%\"}\n\n## Installation of R and RStudio\n\n-   You can download and install **R base** via r-project.org (currently R-4.4.1)\n\n    -   for [Linux](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/)\n\n    -   for [Windows](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/)\n\n    -   for [MacOS](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)\n\n-   Then, after the installation of R, you can download RStudio via posit.co (currently)\n\n    -   for [Windows](https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/windows/RStudio-2024.04.2-764.exe)\n\n    -   for [MacOS](https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/macos/RStudio-2024.04.2-764.dmg)\n\n-   After installation of R and RStudio, you can open up the RStudio to start your R programming.\n\n    -   however, your R only has the **base** package\n\n    -   To enhance its utility, most users will install **R packages** for certain purposes\n\n## R packages\n\n-   R packages are uploaded to some platforms (i.e., CRAN or Github) by researchers or companies\n\n    -   Those R packages typically have their version numbers. Some functions may be available for some version (like Ver. 1.1) but not be available in other versions.\n\n    -   Do not upgrade your packages if you code is running well\n\n-   R users are free to download and use those R packages\n\n    -   To download certain package, you should know package name\n\n    -   For example, if you want to download the latest version of `tidyverse` package, you can type in following command in **the console panel** of Rstudio\n\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n    install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n\n    -   Or if you want to install the older version of package\n\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n    require(devtools)\n    install_version(\"tidyverse\", version = \"1.3.0\", repos = \"http://cran.us.r-project.org\")\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n\n## More about R packages\n\n-   **CRAN** (Comprehensive R Archive Network) is a network of servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R.\n    -   It contains most stable version of packages.\n    -   Most of time, we download package from CRAN\n-   **Github** is for the fast development for R packages\n    -   It contains the up-to-date version of R which may potentially be unstable\n\n    -   You can download the package from Github using `pak` package\n\n\n\n\n\n        ::: {.cell}\n        \n        ```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n        pak::pak(\"tidyverse/ggplot2\")\n        ```\n        :::\n\n\n\n\n\n    -   You can update the package and its dependencies\n\n\n\n\n\n        ::: {.cell}\n        \n        ```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n        pak::pkg_install(\"ggplot2\", upgrade = TRUE)\n        ```\n        :::\n\n\n\n\n\n## R functions\n\n-   To operate certain tasks, you need to use functions contained in R packages\n\n    -   There are two ways of using R functions\n\n    -   **Direct way**: you don't have to load your package first\n\n    -   ![](figures/function.png){width=\"100%\"}\n\n    -   **Use-after-load way**: Package is loaded in your session before you can call the function name without specifying the package name\n\n\n\n\n\n        ::: {.cell}\n        \n        ```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n        require(pak)\n        pkg_install(\"ggplot2\", upgrade = TRUE)\n        ```\n        :::\n\n\n\n\n\n## R functions (Cont.)\n\n-   How do you know you already load the package or not\n\n-   You can use `sessionInfo` function\n\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n    sessionInfo()\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n    R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23)\n    Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\n    Running under: macOS 14.6.1\n    \n    Matrix products: default\n    LAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib\n    \n    locale:\n    [1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n    \n    attached base packages:\n    [1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n    \n    loaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n     [1] compiler_4.2.1    fastmap_1.2.0     cli_3.6.3         tools_4.2.1      \n     [5] htmltools_0.5.8.1 parallel_4.2.1    rstudioapi_0.16.0 yaml_2.3.8       \n     [9] rmarkdown_2.26    knitr_1.46        jsonlite_1.8.8    xfun_0.43        \n    [13] digest_0.6.35     rlang_1.1.4       evaluate_0.23    \n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n\n-   It outputs multiple info:\n\n    -

  **Method 1**: you can click `Run` button in the top right-head of **Rstudio**\n\n    -   **Method 2**: you can select certain code and press `Ctrl + Enter` (Win) or `Command + Return` (Mac)\n\n    -   **Method 3**: you can `Rscript [FILENAME].r` to run the whole script\n\n    -   **Method 4**: you can using R notebook to interactively run R code\n\n+----------------------------+-------------------+-----------------------------+\n|                            | Script file is .R | Script file is .rmd or .qmd |\n+============================+===================+=============================+\n| **Run the whole script**   | -

You can answer the questions via Laptop, PC or Mobile Phone.\n\n    -   Make sure your device connect to the Internet.\n\n-   Let me use [Homework 0](https://jihongzhang.org/posts/Lectures/2024-07-21-applied-multivariate-statistics-esrm64503/HWs/HW_demo.html) as one example.\n\n## Summary\n\n1.  Note that the syllabus, schedule, and all materials are uploaded online the week before class.\n2.  We learn that R, Rstudio, and Quarto (*.qmd*) can be used to execute R code/syntax.\n3.  In-class quiz will be administered in the begining of class. Should be quick and easy. Don't be stressful ever!\n4.  Office hour will be 2PM - 4PM on Tuesday. Feel free to stop by my office and ask questions.\n5.  Next week, we will start to reiterate general linear regression.\n\n## Next Week\n\nWe will:\n\n1.  Talk about descriptive statistics, data visualization and general linear model\n2.  HW0 will be due before **CLASS BEGINS** on Monday\n",
