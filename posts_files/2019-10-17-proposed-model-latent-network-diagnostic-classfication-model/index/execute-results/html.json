Epskamp(2017) introduces a network model as a formal psychometric model by conceptualizing the covariance between psychometric indicators as resulting from pairwise interactions between observable variabls in a network structure.\n\n$$\n\\alpha_1 = \\beta_{12}\\alpha_2 +\\beta_{13}\\alpha_3 +...+\\beta_{1k}\\alpha_k \\\\\n\\alpha_2 = \\beta_{21}\\alpha_1 + \\beta_{23}\\alpha_3 +...+\\beta_{2k}\\alpha_k \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\alpha_{k} = \\beta_{k1}\\alpha_1 + \\beta_{k2}\\alpha_2 + ... +\\beta_{(k-1)k}\\alpha_k\\\\\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha_k$ is the $k$th latent attributes and $\\beta$ is the conditional independence relationships between latent attributes. For example, $\\beta_{12}$ the conditional relationship between $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ when controlling for other attributes.\n\nWhile DCM is a powerful tool for understanding the attribute profiles of individuals, this is not fully efficient when estimating and testing the Hierarchical structue of latent attributes (Templin & Bradshaw, 2014). The LNDCM could be employed to examine the relationships among latent attributes and then help better understand the kownledge structure.\n\n## Reference\nJonathan T, Laine Bradshaw, 2014.
