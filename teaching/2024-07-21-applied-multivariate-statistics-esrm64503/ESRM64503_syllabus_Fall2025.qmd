## Course Objectives, Materials, and Prerequisites

The online syllabus at the address provided above will always have the most up-to-date information. This course focuses on multivariate statistical procedures as applied to educational research settings, with an emphasis on the use of existing computer statistical packages.

The course has two main objectives:

1.  **Modern multivariate analysis using observed variables**
2.  **Building a foundation in terminology, concepts, and software to enable participants to learn more advanced analyses in the future**

This course provides an exploration of multivariate statistics within the context of education and psychology. Class time will be devoted primarily to lectures and examples. Lecture materials in .html format will be available for download and viewing at the website above the day prior to class, or paper copies will be provided in class. Audio/video recordings of the class lectures in .mp4 format will also be posted online upon request, but are not intended to take the place of class attendance. Selected book chapters and journal articles will be assigned for each specific topic as needed. The initial list of readings is provided below but will likely be updated throughout the semester. Updates to the reading list will be posted in the online syllabus and announced in class and via email. The [R](https://www.r-project.org/) language will be the primary statistical tool used throughout the course, with [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) as the user interface.

## Prerequisite

Participants should be familiar with the general linear model (such as analysis of variance, linear regression) prior to enrolling in this course.

Also, it is assumed that students have has solid statistical training up to and including topics in multivariate statistics (ESRM 64103 Experimental Design in Education, and ESRM 64203 Multiple Regression Techniques for Education). In addition, it is assumed you are also familiar with R language. SPSS may not be sufficient for this course.

However, extensions may be granted as needed for extenuating circumstances (e.g., conferences, family obligations) if requested at least three weeks in advance of the due date. As noted above, missed in-class quizzes cannot be made up.

# Academic Policies

## AI Statement

Specific permissions will be provided to students regarding the use of generative artificial intelligence tools on certain graded activities in this course. In these instances, I will communicate explicit permission, as well as expectations and any pertinent limitations for use and attribution. Without this permission, the use of generative artificial intelligence tools in any capacity while completing academic work submitted for credit—independently or collaboratively—will be considered academic dishonesty and reported to the Office of Academic Initiatives and Integrity.

## Academic Integrity

As a core part of its mission, the University of Arkansas provides students with the opportunity to further their educational goals through programs of study and research in an environment that promotes freedom of inquiry and academic responsibility. Accomplishing this mission is only possible when intellectual honesty and individual integrity prevail.

Each University of Arkansas student is required to be familiar with and abide by the University's **Academic Integrity Policy** at [honesty.uark.edu/policy](https://honesty.uark.edu/policy). Students with questions about how these policies apply to a particular course or assignment should immediately contact their instructor.

## Emergency Preparedness

The University of Arkansas is committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for study and work. To that end, the university has developed a campus safety plan and an emergency preparedness plan to respond to a variety of emergency situations. The emergency preparedness plan can be found at [emergency.uark.edu](https://emergency.uark.edu). Additionally, the university uses a campus-wide emergency notification system, UARKAlert, to communicate important emergency information via email and text messaging. To learn more and to sign up, visit: <http://safety.uark.edu/emergency-preparedness/emergency-notification-system/>

## Inclement Weather

If you have any questions about whether class will be canceled due to inclement weather, please contact me. If I cancel class, I will notify you via email and/or Blackboard. In general, students need to know how and when they will be notified in the event that class is canceled for weather-related reasons. Please see [here](http://safety.uark.edu/inclement-weather/) for more information.

## Access and Accommodations

Your experience in this class is important to me. University of Arkansas [Academic Policy Series 1520.10](https://provost.uark.edu/policies/152010.php) requires that students with disabilities be provided reasonable accommodations to ensure their equal access to course content. If you have already established accommodations with the Center for Educational Access (CEA), please request your accommodations letter early in the semester and contact me privately so that we have adequate time to arrange your approved academic accommodations.

If you have **not** yet established services through CEA, but have a documented disability and require accommodations *(conditions include but are not limited to: mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical, health, or temporary impacts)*, contact CEA directly to set up an Access Plan. CEA facilitates the interactive process that establishes reasonable accommodations. For more information on CEA registration procedures, contact 479–575–3104, [ada\@uark.edu](mailto:ada@uark.edu), or visit [cea.uark.edu](https://cea.uark.edu/).

## Academic Support

A complete list and brief description of academic support programs can be found on the University's Academic Support site, along with links to the specific services, hours, and locations. Faculty are encouraged to be familiar with these programs and to assist students with finding and using the support services that will help them be successful. Please see [here](http://www.uark.edu/academics/academic-support.php) for more information.

## Religious Holidays

The university does not observe religious holidays; however, Campus Council has passed the following resolution concerning individual observance of religious holidays and class attendance:

> When members of any religion seek to be excused from class for religious reasons, they are expected to provide their instructors with a schedule of religious holidays that they intend to observe, in writing, before the completion of the first week of classes.

# Schedule

Following materials are only allowed for previewing for students registered in ESRM 64503. DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THEM on the internet. They will be removed after the course ended.
