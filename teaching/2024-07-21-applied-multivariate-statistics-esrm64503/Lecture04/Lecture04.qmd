# ESRM 64503: Homework 1

## Question 1

<details>

-   Copy and paste your R syntax and R output that calculates the group **Senior-Old's standard error of group mean** (use the data and model we've used in class).

    -   **Aim**: Test whether the group mean of senior-old significantly higher than the baseline (here, 0 score)

$$
\mathbf{Test = \beta_0 +\beta_1Senior + \beta_2New +\beta_3Senior*New}
$$

-   The group mean of Senior-Old is $\beta_0 + \beta_1$.

-   Based on algebra for variance, we know that

$$
Var(\beta_0 + \beta_1) = Var(\beta_0)+Var(\beta_1) +2*Cov(\beta_0, \beta_1)
$$

-   `vcov` function provides the variances and covariances for $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, and $\beta_3$

```{r}
#| output-location: default
#| results: hide
#| echo: false
# R syntax
library(ESRM64503)
library(tidyverse)
model1 <- lm(Test ~ Senior + New + Senior * New, data = dataTestExperiment)
data("dataTestExperiment")
Var_beta_0 <- vcov(model1)[1,1]
Var_beta_1 <- vcov(model1)[2,2]
Cov_beta_0_1 <- vcov(model1)[1,2]
Var_Test_SeniorOld <- Var_beta_0 + Var_beta_1 + 2*Cov_beta_0_1
(SE_Test_SeniorOld <- sqrt(Var_Test_SeniorOld)) 
```

</details>

## Question 3

<details>

-   Copy and paste your R syntax and R output that calculates the standard error of conditional main effect of New (New vs. Old) when Senior = 1.

    -   **Aim**: Test whether the conditional main effect of New when Senior significantly different from 0
        -   In other words, when individuals are senior, whether new or old instruction method has significantly differences in their test scores

$$
\beta_{2|Senior =1} = \beta_2 + \beta_3 * 1
$$

-   Based on algebra for variance, we know that

$$
Var(\beta_2 + \beta_3) = Var(\beta_2)+Var(\beta_3) +2*Cov(\beta_2, \beta_3)
$$

-   `vcov` function provides the variances and covariances for $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, and $\beta_3$

```{r}
#| output-location: default
#| results: hide
#| echo: false


# R syntax
Var_beta_2 <- vcov(model1)[3,3]
Var_beta_3 <- vcov(model1)[4,4]
Cov_beta_2_3 <- vcov(model1)[3,4]
Var_betaofNew_Senior1 <- Var_beta_2 + Var_beta_3 + 2*Cov_beta_2_3
(SE_betaofNew_Senior1 <- sqrt(Var_betaofNew_Senior1)) 
```

</details>

# Unit 1: Random Variables & Statistical Distribution

## Definition of Random Variables

-   [**Random:**]{.underline} situations in which the certainty of the outcome is unknown and is at least in part due to chance

-   [**Variable:**]{.underline} a value that may change given the scope of a given problem or set of operations

-   [**Random Variable**]{.underline}: a variable whose outcome depends on chance (possible values represent the potential outcomes of a future experiment)

Today, we will denote a random variable with lowercase letters: ***x***

**Question**: which one in the following options is random variable:

a.  any company's revenue in 2024

b.  one specific company's monthly revenue in 2024

c.  companies whose revenue is over \$30 billion

**My answer**: [only (a)]{.mohu}

## Types of Random Variables

1.  **Continuous**
    -   Examples of continuous random variables:
        -   ***x*** represents the height of a person, drawn at random
        -   *Y* (the outcome/DV in a GLM)
        -   Some variables like **exam scores or motivation scores** are not truly continuous variables, but it is convenient to treat them as continuous
2.  **Discrete** (also called categorical, generally)
    -   Examples of discrete random variables:
        -   ***x*** represents the gender of a person, drawn at random
        -   *Y* (outcomes like yes/no; pass/not pass; master / not master a skill; survive / die)
3.  **Mixture of Continuous and Discrete**:
    -   Example of a mixture: \begin{equation}
          x =
        \begin{cases}
          RT & \text{between 0 and 45 seconds} \\
          0 & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases}       
        \end{equation}

## Key Features of Random Variable

1.  Random variables are each described by a **probability density / mass function (PDF)** â€“ $f(x)$

    -   PDF indicates relative frequency of occurrence

    -   A PDF is a mathematical function that provides a rough picture of the distribution from which a random variable is drawn

2.  The type of random variable dictates the name and nature of these functions:

    -   [Continuous random variables]{style="color: tomato"}:

        -   $f(x)$ is called a probability density function

        -   Area under curve must equal to 1 (found by calculus integration)

        -   Height of curve (the function value $f(x)$):

            -   Can be any positive number

            -   Reflects relative likelihood of an observation occurring

    -   [Discrete random variables]{style="color: violet"}:

        -   $f(x)$ is called a probability mass function

        -   Sum across all values must equal 1

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {.callout-note style="font-size: 1.4em;"}
Both maximum and minimum temperature values can be considered continuous random variables.
:::

-   Question 1: What are the probabilities when integrating over all values of maximum and minimum temperatures ({1, 1} or {0.5, 0.5})?

-   **Answer**: [It is {1, 1} for maximum and minimum temperatures because they are two separate random variables.]{.mohu}

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| output-location: default
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-asp: .5
library(tidyverse)
temp <- read.csv("data/temp_fayetteville.csv")
temp$value_F <- (temp$value / 10 * 1.8) + 32
temp |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_density(aes(x = value_F, fill = datatype), col = "white", alpha = .8) +
  labs(x = "Max/Min Temperature (F) at Fayetteville, AR (Sep-2023)", 
       caption = "Source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (https://www.noaa.gov/)") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(temp$value_F), max(temp$value_F), by = 5)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("tomato", "turquoise")) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 13) 
```

## Other key Terms

-   The sample space is the set of all values that a random variable x can take:
    -   **Example 1:** The sample space for a random variable x from a normal distribution $x \sim N(\mu_x, \sigma^2_x)$ is $(-\infty, +\infty)$.
    -   **Example 2:** The sample space for a random variable x representing the outcome of a coin flip is {H, T}
    -   **Example 3:** The sample space for a random variable x representing the outcome of a roll of a die is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
-   When using generalized models, the key is to select a distribution with a sample space that matches the range of values obtainable from the data
    -   Logistic regression - Match Bernoulli distribution [(Example 2)]{.mohu}
    -   Poisson regression - Match Poisson distribution [(Example 3)]{.mohu}

## Uses of Distributions in Data Analysis

-   Statistical models make distributional assumptions on various parameters and / or parts of data

-   These assumptions govern:

    -   How models are estimated

    -   How inferences are made

    -   How missing data may be imputed

-   If data do not follow an assumed distribution, inferences may be inaccurate

    -   Sometimes a very big problem, other times not so much

-   Therefore, it can be helpful to check distributional assumptions prior to running statistical analysis

## Continuous Univariate distributions

-   To demonstrate how continuous distributions work and look, we will discuss three:

    -   Uniform distribution

    -   Normal distribution

    -   Chi-square distribution

-   Each distribution is described by a set of parameters, which we will later see provide the basis for our inferences when we analyze data

-   We then place constraints on those parameters based on hypothesized effects in the data

## Uniform distribution

-   The uniform distribution helps us understand how continuous distributions work

    -   Typically used in simulation studies where parameters are randomly generated

-   For a continuous random variable x that ranges from (a, b), the uniform probability density function is:

    $f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}$

-   The uniform distribution has two parameters

    ```{r}
    x = seq(0, 3, .1)
    y = dunif(x, min = 0, max = 3)
    ggplot() +
      geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
      geom_path(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
      theme_bw()
    ```

## More on the Uniform Distribution

-   To demonstrate how PDFs work, we will try a few values:

```{r}
conditions <- tribble(
   ~x, ~a, ~b,
   .5,  0,  1,
  .75,  0,  1,
   15,  0, 20,
   15, 10, 20
) |> 
  mutate(y = dunif(x, min = a, max = b))
conditions
```

-   The uniform PDF has the feature that all values of ***x*** are equally likely across the sample space of the distribution
    -   Therefore, you do not see ***x*** in the PDF $f(x)$
-   The mean of the uniform distribution is $\frac{1}{2}(a+b)$
-   The variance of the uniform distribution is $\frac{1}{12}(b-a)^2$

## Univariate Normal Distribution

-   For a continuous random variable ***x*** (ranging from $-\infty$ to $\infty$), the univariate normal distribution function is:

$$
f(x) = \frac1{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2_x}}\exp(-\frac{(x-\mu_x)^2}{2\sigma^2_x})
$$

-   The shape of the distribution is governed by two parameters:

    -   The mean $\mu_x$

    -   The variance $\sigma^2_x$

    -   These parameters are called **sufficient statistics** (they contain all the information about the distribution)

-   The skewness (lean) and kurtosis (peakedness) are fixed

-   Standard notation for normal distributions is $x\sim N(\mu_x, \sigma^2_x)$

    -   Read as: "*x* follows a normal distribution with a mean $\mu_x$ and a variance $\sigma^2_x$"

-   Linear combinations of random variables following normal distributions result in a random variable that is normally distributed

## Univariate Normal Distribution in R: `pnorm`

Density (`dnorm`), distribution function (`pnorm`), quantile function (`qnorm`) and random generation (`rnorm`) for the normal distribution with mean equal to `mean` and standard deviation equal to `sd`.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
Z = seq(-5, 5, .1) # Z-score
ggplot() +
  aes(x = Z, y = pnorm(q = Z, lower.tail = TRUE)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_path() +
  labs(x = "Z-score", y = "Cumulative probability",
       title = "`pnorm()` gives the cumulative probability function P(X < T)")
```

::: panel-tabset
### Exercise - pnorm

95% CI: Try to confirm that the probability of x locating between $\pm$ 2SD is around 95%.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "R code"
#| fig-align: "center"
x = seq(-5, 5, .01)
y = dnorm(x)
x_pm2sd = c(-2, seq(-2, 2, .01), 2)
y_pm2sd = c(0, dnorm(seq(-2, 2, .01)), 0)
data.frame(x, y) |> 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = x, y = y) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "grey", alpha = .5) +
  geom_polygon(aes(x = x_pm2sd, y = y_pm2sd), data = data.frame(x_pm2sd, y_pm2sd), fill = "tomato", alpha = .8) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-5, 5, .5)) +
  geom_label(x = 0, y = 0.15, label = "~ 95%") +
  labs(y = "Probability of X = x") +
  theme_classic()
```

```{webr-r}
lb <- pnorm(____________) # The cumulative probability of x = -2SD
ub <- pnorm(____________) # The cumulative probability of x = 2SD
____________
```

### Answer

```{webr-r}
lb <- pnorm(-2, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE)
ub <- pnorm(2, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE)
ub - lb
```

## Univariate Normal Distribution in R: `dnorm`

For example, `dnrom(x = 0, mean = 0, sd = 1)` will calculate the density probability of x = 1 in a standard normal distribution.

So, $\mu_x = 0$, $x = 0$, and $\sigma_x = 1$:

$$
f(x = 0) = \frac1{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2_x}}\exp(-\frac{(x-\mu_x)^2}{2\sigma^2_x}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \approx 0.398
$$

```{r}
dnorm(x = 0, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
x <- seq(-5, 5, .1)

params <- list(
  y_set1 = c(mu =  0, sigma2 = 0.2),
  y_set2 = c(mu =  0, sigma2 = 1.0),
  y_set3 = c(mu =  0, sigma2 = 5.0),
  y_set4 = c(mu = -2, sigma2 = 0.5)
)

y <- sapply(params, function(param) dnorm(x, mean = param['mu'], sd = param['sigma2']))

dt <- cbind(x, y) |> 
  as.data.frame() |> 
  pivot_longer(starts_with("y_"))

ggplot(dt) +
  geom_path(aes(x = x, y = value, color = name, group = name), linewidth = 1.3) +
  scale_color_manual(values = 1:4,
                     name = "",
                     labels = c('y_set1' = expression(mu*"=0, "*sigma^2*"=.02"),
                                'y_set2' = expression(mu*"=0, "*sigma^2*"=1.0"),
                                'y_set3' = expression(mu*"=0, "*sigma^2*"=5.0"),
                                'y_set4' = expression(mu*"=-2, "*sigma^2*"=0.5"))
                     ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "top", text = element_text(size = 13))
```

## Chi-Square Distribution

-   Another frequently used univariate distribution is the Chi-square distribution

    -   Sampling distribution of the variance follows a chi-square distribution

    -   Likelihood ratios follow a chi-square distribution

    -   F-distributed random variable can be expressed as the ratio of two independent gamma-distributed random variables

-   For a continuous random variable *x* (ranging from 0 to $\infty$), the chi-square distribution is given by:

    $$
    \chi^2(x) =\frac1{2^{\frac{\upsilon}{2}} \Gamma(\frac{\upsilon}{2})} x^{\frac{\upsilon}{2}-1} \exp(-\frac{x}2)
    $$

-   $\Gamma(\cdot)$ is called the gamma function

-   The chi-square distribution is governed by one parameter: $\upsilon$ (the degrees of freedom)

    -   The mean is equal to $\upsilon$; the variance is equal to 2$\upsilon$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| warning: false
x <- seq(0.01, 15, .01)
df <- c(1, 2, 3, 5, 10)
dt2 <- as.data.frame(sapply(df, \(df) dchisq(x, df = df)))
dt2_with_x <- cbind(x = x, dt2)
dt2_with_x |> 
  pivot_longer(starts_with("V")) |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_path(aes(x = x, y = value, color = name), linewidth = 1.2) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1)) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "", labels = paste("df =", df)) +
  labs(x = "x", y = "f(x)",
       title = "Chi-square Distributions with Different Parameters",
       color = "Parameters") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "top", text = element_text(size = 13))
```

## Gamma Distribution Practice

-   The chi-square distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution.

    -   Specifically, a chi-square distribution with (k) degrees of freedom is equivalent to a gamma distribution with a shape parameter of (k/2) and a rate parameter of (1/2) (or a scale parameter of 2).

-   The gamma distribution is another important continuous distribution, particularly useful for modeling waiting times and positive continuous data. It has two parameters: shape ($\alpha$) and rate ($\beta$).

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| output-location: default
# Gamma distribution with different shape and rate parameters
x <- seq(0.01, 10, .01)
shape_params <- c(1, 2, 3, 5)
rate_params <- c(1, 1, 2, 1)

# Create data for different gamma distributions
gamma_data <- data.frame()
for(i in 1:length(shape_params)) {
  temp_data <- data.frame(
    x = x,
    density = dgamma(x, shape = shape_params[i], rate = rate_params[i]),
    distribution = paste0("Gamma(", shape_params[i], ", ", rate_params[i], ")")
  )
  gamma_data <- rbind(gamma_data, temp_data)
}

# Plot the distributions
ggplot(gamma_data) +
  geom_path(aes(x = x, y = density, color = distribution), linewidth = 1.2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "blue", "green", "purple")) +
  labs(x = "x", y = "f(x)",
       title = "Gamma Distributions with Different Parameters",
       color = "Parameters") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "top", text = element_text(size = 13))
```

# Marginal, Joint, And Conditional Distribution

## Moving from One to Multiple Random Variables

-   When more than one random variable is present, there are several different types of statistical distributions:

-   We will first consider two discrete random variables:

    -   *x* is the outcome of the flip of a penny {$H_p$, $T_p$}

        -   $f(x=H_p) = .5$; $f(x =T_p) = .5$

    -   *z* is the outcome of the flip of a dime {$H_d$, $T_d$}

        -   $f(z=H_d) = .5$; $f(z =T_d) = .5$

-   We will consider the following distributions:

    -   Marginal distribution

        -   The distribution of one variable only (either $f(x)$ or $f(z)$)

    -   Joint distribution

        -   $f(x, z)$: the distribution of both variables (both *x* and *z*)

    -   **Conditional distribution**

        -   The distribution of one variable, conditional on values of the other:

            -   $f(x|z)$: the distribution of *x* given *z*

            -   $f(z|x)$: the distribution of *z* given x

## Marginal Distribution

-   Marginal distributions are what we have worked with exclusively up to this point: they represent the distribution by itself

    -   Continuous univariate distributions

        -   Adult heights (Normal)

        -   Time between arrivals (Exponential)

        -   Device lifetimes (Weibull)

        -   Proportions on [0,1] (Beta)

    -   Categorical distributions

        -   The flip of a penny

        -   The flip of a dime

        -   The roll of a fair die (1â€“6)

        -   Day of the week (Monâ€“Sun)

-----------------------------

### Visualization of marginal and joint distribution

#| fig-cap: 
#|   - "marginal (die) distribution"
#|   -  "joint (penny Ã— dime) distribution"

  labs(title = "Marginal: Fair Die", x = "Face", y = "Probability") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 0.25)) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)

# Joint categorical distribution: penny Ã— dime (independent, fair)
joint <- expand.grid(penny = c("H", "T"), dime = c("H", "T"))
joint$p <- 0.25
p2 <- ggplot(joint, aes(x = penny, y = dime, fill = p)) +

  labs(title = "Joint: Penny Ã— Dime", x = "Penny", y = "Dime", fill = "Probability") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)

```

## Joint Distribution

-   Joint distributions describe the simultaneous distribution of more than one variable

    -   These represent multiple variables collected together

    -   Commonly, the joint distribution function is denoted with all random variables separated by commas

    -   In our example, $f(x,z)$ is the joint distribution of the outcome of flipping both a penny and a dime

        -   As both are discrete, the joint distribution has four possible values:

            \(1\) $f(x = H_p,z=H_d)$ (2) $f(x = H_p,z=T_d)$ (3) $f(x = T_p,z=H_d)$ (4) $f(x = T_p,z=T_d)$

-   Joint distributions are **multivariate distributions**

-   We will use joint distributions to introduce two topics

    -   Joint distributions of independent variables

    -   Joint distributions â€“ used in maximum likelihood estimation

--------------------------

### Joint Distributions of Independent Random Variables

-   Random variables are said to be independent if the occurrence of one event makes it neither more nor less probable of another event

    -   For joint distributions, this means: $f(x,z)=f(x)f(z)$

-   In our example, flipping a penny and flipping a dime are independent â€“ so we can complete the following table of their joint distribution:

    |   | z = $H_d$ | z = $T_d$ | Marginal (Penny) |
    |----|----|----|----|
    | $x = H_p$ | $\color{tomato}{f(x=H_p, z=H_d)}$ | $\color{tomato}{f(x=H_p, z=T_d)}$ | $\color{turquoise}{f(z=H_p)}$ |
    | $x = T_p$ | $\color{tomato}{f(x= T_p, z=H_d)}$ | $\color{tomato}{f(x=T_p, z=T_d)}$ | $\color{turquoise}{f(z=T_d)}$ |
    | Marginal (Dime) | $\color{turquoise}{f(z=H_d)}$ | $\color{turquoise}{f(z=T_d)}$ |  |

------------------------------

### Joint Distributions of Independent Random Variables

-   Because the coin flips are independent, this becomes:

|   | z = $H_d$ | z = $T_d$ | Marginal (Penny) |
|----|----|----|----|
| $x = H_p$ | $\color{tomato}{f(x=H_p)f( z=H_d)}$ | $\color{tomato}{f(x=H_p)f( z=T_d)}$ | $\color{turquoise}{f(z=H_p)}$ |
| $x = T_p$ | $\color{tomato}{f(x= T_p)f( z=H_d)}$ | $\color{tomato}{f(x=T_p)f( z=T_d)}$ | $\color{turquoise}{f(z=T_d)}$ |
| Marginal (Dime) | $\color{turquoise}{f(z=H_d)}$ | $\color{turquoise}{f(z=T_d)}$ |  |

-   Then, with numbers:

|   | z = $H_d$ | z = $T_d$ | Marginal (Penny) |
|----|----|----|----|
| $x = H_p$ | $\color{tomato}{.25}$ | $\color{tomato}{.25}$ | $\color{turquoise}{.5}$ |
| $x = T_p$ | $\color{tomato}{.25}$ | $\color{tomato}{.25}$ | $\color{turquoise}{.5}$ |
| Marginal (Dime) | $\color{turquoise}{.5}$ | $\color{turquoise}{.5}$ |  |

### Marginalizing Across a Joint Distribution

-   If you had a joint distribution, $\color{orchid}{f(x, z)}$, but wanted the marginal distribution of either variable ($f(x)$ or $f(z)$) you would have to **marginalize** across one dimension of the joint distribution.

-   For [**categorical random variables**]{.underline}, marginalizing means summing across every value of z

$$
f(x) = \sum_zf(x, z)
$$

-   For example, $f(x = H_p) = f(x = H_p, z=H_d) +f(x = H_p, z=T_d)=.5$

-   For [**continuous random variables**]{.underline}, marginalizing means integrating across z

    -   The integral:

        $$
        f(x) = \int_zf(x,z)dz
        $$

## Conditional Distribution

-   For two random variables x and z, a conditional distribution is written as: $f(z|x)$

    -   The distribution of z given x

-   The conditional distribution equals the joint distribution divided by the marginal distribution of the conditioning variable

    $$
    f(z|x) = \frac{f(z,x)}{f(x)}
    $$

-   Conditional distributions are found everywhere in statistics

    -   The general linear model uses the conditional distribution of the variable

        $$
        Y \sim N(\beta_0+\beta_1X, \sigma^2_e)
        $$

------------------

### Example: Conditional Distribution

-   For two discrete random variables with {0, 1} values, the conditional distribution can be shown in a contingency table:

|   | z = $H_d$ | z = $T_d$ | Marginal (Penny) |
|----|----|----|----|
| $x = H_p$ | $\color{tomato}{.25}$ | $\color{tomato}{.25}$ | $\color{turquoise}{.5}$ |
| $x = T_p$ | $\color{tomato}{.25}$ | $\color{tomato}{.25}$ | $\color{turquoise}{.5}$ |
| Marginal (Dime) | $\color{turquoise}{.5}$ | $\color{turquoise}{.5}$ |  |

Conditional: $f(z | x= H_p)$:

$f(z=H_d|x =H_p) = \frac{f(z=H_d, x=H_p)}{f(x = H_p)} = \frac{.25}{.5}=.5$

$f(z = T_d | x = H_p)= \frac{f(z=T_d, x=H_p)}{f(x=H_p)} = \frac{.25}{.5} = .5$

---------------------

### Exercise: calculate conditional probabilities

Using the same penny (x) and dime (z) setup, suppose the joint distribution is slightly modified as follows:

|   | z = $H_d$ | z = $T_d$ |
|----|----|----|
| $x = H_p$ | 0.30 | 0.20 |
| $x = T_p$ | 0.20 | 0.30 |

-   Compute the marginal probabilities: $P(x=H_p)$, $P(x=T_p)$, $P(z=H_d)$, $P(z=T_d)$.
-   Compute the conditional probabilities: $P(z=H_d\mid x=H_p)$ and $P(x=T_p\mid z=T_d)$.
-   Briefly show your work (fractions from the table entries).

Marginals:

- $P(x=H_p) = 0.30 + 0.20 = 0.50$
- $P(x=T_p) = 0.20 + 0.30 = 0.50$
- $P(z=H_d) = 0.30 + 0.20 = 0.50$
- $P(z=T_d) = 0.20 + 0.30 = 0.50$

Conditionals:

- $P(z=H_d\mid x=H_p) = \dfrac{0.30}{0.50} = 0.60$
- $P(x=T_p\mid z=T_d) = \dfrac{0.30}{0.50} = 0.60$

# Expected Values and The Algebra of Expectation

## Expected Values

-   Expected values are statistics calculated over the sample space of a random variable: they are essentially weighted averages:

    ```{r}
    #| output-location: default
    set.seed(1234)
    x = rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
    w = dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1)
    mean(w * x)
    ```

-   Where $w$ denotes the density function of x: $f(x)$

-   The weights used in computing this average correspond to the probabilities (for discrete random variables) or the densities (for continuous random variables)

::: {.callout-note font-size="1.2em"}
The expected value is represented by $E(x)$

The actual statistic being weighted by the PDF is placed in the parentheses where x appears
:::

-   Expected values allow us to understand what a statistical model implies about data, for instance:

    -   How a GLM specifies the (conditional) mean and variance of a DV

## Expected Value Calculation

-   For discrete random variables, the expected value is found by:

    $$
    E(x) = \sum{x \times P(X=x)}
    $$

-   For example, the expected value of a roll of a die is:

    $$
    E(x) = (1)\frac16+ (2)\frac16+(3)\frac16+(4)\frac16+(5)\frac16+6\frac16
    $$

-   For continuous random variables, the expected value is found by

    $$
    E(x) = \int_x xf(x)dx
    $$

-   We won't be calculating theoretical expected values using calculus... we use them only to understand what our models imply about the data

## Variance and Covariance... As Expected Values

-   A distribution's theoretical variance can also be written as an expected value:

    $$
    V(x) = E(x-E(x))^2 = E(x -\mu_x)^2
    $$

    -   This formula helps us understand predictions made by GLMs and how that corresponds to statistical parameters we interpret

-   For a roll of a die, the theoretical variance is:

    $$
    V(x) = E(x - 3.5)^2 = \frac16(1-3.5)^2 + \frac16(2-3.5)^2 + \frac16(3-3.5)^2 + \frac16(4-3.5)^2 + \frac16(5-3.5)^2 + \frac16(6-3.5)^2 = 2.92
    $$

-   Likewise, for a pair of random variable *x* and *z*, the covariance can be found from their joint distributions:

    $$
    \text{Cov}(x,z)=E(xz)-E(x)E(z) = E(xz)-\mu_x\mu_z
    $$

```{r}
#| results: hold
set.seed(1234)
N = 100
x = rnorm(N, 2, 1)
z = rnorm(N, 3, 1)
xz = x*z
(Cov_xz = mean(xz)-mean(x)*mean(z)) / ((N-1)/N) # unbiased covariance
cov(x, z)
```

# Linear Combination of Random Variables

## Linear Combinations of Random Variables

-   A linear combination is an expression constructed from a set of terms by multiplying each term by a constant and then adding the results $$
    x = c + a_1z_1+a_2z_2+a_3z_3 +\cdots+a_nz_n
    $$

-   More generally, linear combinations of random variables have specific implications for the mean, variance, and possibly covariance of the new random variable

-   As such, there are predictable ways in which the means, variances, and covariances change

## Algebra of Expectations

-   Sums of Constants

$$
E(x+c) = E(x)+c \\
\text{Var}(x+c) = \text{Var}(x) \\
\text{Cov}(x+c, z) = \text{Cov}(x, z)
$$

### Example

Imagine for weight variable, each individual increases 3 lbs:

```{r}
#| output-location: default
set.seed(1234)
library(ESRM64503)
x = dataSexHeightWeight$weightLB
c_ = 3
z = dataSexHeightWeight$heightIN
mean(x + c_); mean(x)+c_
var(x + c_); var(x)
cov(x, z); cov(x+c_, z) # decimal place issue, near() accepts two values' diff less than .00001
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Products of Constants:

$$
E(cx) = cE(x) \\
\text{Var}(cx) = c^2\text{Var}(x) \\
\text{Cov}(cx, dz) = c*d*\text{Cov}(x, z)
$$ Imagine you wanted to convert weight from pounds to kilograms (where 1 pound = 0.453 kg) and convert height from inches to cm (where 1 inch = 2.54 cm)

```{r}
#| output-location: default

c_ = .453
mean(x*c_); mean(x)*c_
var(x*c_); var(x)*c_^2

d_ = 2.54
cov(c_*x, d_*z);c_*d_*cov(x, z)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Sums of Multiple Random Variables:

$$
E(cx+dz) = cE(x) + dE(z) \\
\text{Var}(cx+dz) = c^2\text{Var}(x) + d^2\text{Var}(z) + 2c*d*\text{Cov}(x,z)\\
$$

```{r}
#| output-location: default
mean(x*c_+z*d_); mean(x)*c_+mean(z)*d_
var(x*c_+z*d_); c_^2*var(x) + d_^2*var(z) + 2*c_*d_*cov(x, z)
```

## Where We Use This Algebra

-   Recall how we calculated the standard error of the conditional main effect using the simple main effect and interaction effect

$$
\mathbf{Test = 82.20 + 2.16*Senior + 7.76*New - 3.04*Senior*New}
$$

-   The conditional main effect of Senior when New equals 1 is (2.16 - 3.04) = -0.88

    -   We know that $\text{Var}(\beta_{\text{Senior}})$ is 0.575, $\text{Var}(\beta_{\text{Senior*New}})$ is 1.151, and $\text{Cov}(\beta_{\text{Senior}}, \beta_{\text{Senior*New}})$ is -0.575.

```{r}
#| output-location: default
model1 <- lm(Test ~ Senior + New + Senior * New, data = dataTestExperiment)
vcov(model1)
```

Then,

$$
\mathbf{Var(\beta_{Senior}+\beta_{Senior*New}) = Var(\beta_{Senior}) + Var(\beta_{Senior*New}) + 2Cov(\beta_{Senior},\beta_{Senior*New})
\\ = 0.575 + 1.151 - 2* 0.575 = 0.576} 
$$ Thus, $SE(\beta_{Senior}+\beta_{Senior*New})=0.759$

## Combining the GLM with Expectations

-   Using the algebra of expectations for predicting Y from X and Z:

$$
\hat{Y}_p=E(Y_p)=E(\beta_0+\beta_1X_p+\beta_2Z_p+\beta_3X_pZ_p+e_p) \\
= \beta_0+\beta_1X_p+\beta_2Z_p+\beta_3X_pZ_p+E(e_p) \\
= \beta_0+\beta_1X_p+\beta_2Z_p+\beta_3X_pZ_p
$$

-   The variance of $f(Y_p|X_p, Z_p)$:

$$
V(Y_P)=V(\beta_0+\beta_1X_p+\beta_2Z_p+\beta_3X_pZ_p+e_p)\\ = V(e_p)=\sigma_e^2
$$

## Understanding These Concepts in the Context of Data

-   Recall from the regression analysis of the height/weight data that the final model we decided to interpret was Model 5

$$
W_p = \beta_0+\beta_1 (H_p-\bar{H}) +\beta_2F_p+\beta_3 (H_p-\bar{H}) F_p + e_p
$$

where $e_p \sim N(0, \sigma_e^2)$

```{r}
#| output-location: default
dat <- dataSexHeightWeight
dat$heightIN_MC <- dat$heightIN - mean(dat$heightIN)
dat$female <- dat$sex == 'F'
mod5 <- lm(weightLB ~ heightIN_MC + female + female*heightIN_MC, data = dat)
summary(mod5)
```

## Picturing the GLM with Distributions

-   The distributional assumptions of the GLM explain why we do not need to worry about whether our dependent variable is normally distributed

-   Our dependent variable should be conditionally normal

-   We can check this assumption by examining the residuals: $e_p \sim N(0, \sigma^2_e)$

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output-location: default
library(ggridges)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
set.seed(1234)
pred_y <- predict(mod5, newdata = dat)
pred_y_dat <- data.frame(Point = names(pred_y), weightLB = pred_y, 
                         heightIN_MC = dat$heightIN_MC)
sigma <- sd(residuals(mod5))

residual_dat <- as.data.frame(sapply(pred_y, \(x) rnorm(100, mean = x, sd = sigma)))

residual_dat_long <- residual_dat |> 
  pivot_longer(everything())

colnames(residual_dat_long) <- c("Point", "weightLBVariant")

residual_dat_long <- residual_dat_long |> 
  left_join(pred_y_dat) |> 
  arrange(Point) 

ggplot() +
  geom_density_ridges(aes(x = weightLBVariant, y = as.factor(round(heightIN_MC, 3))), 
                      data = residual_dat_long, rel_min_height = 0.005, alpha = .5,
                      scale = .7) + 
  geom_point(aes(col = female, x = weightLB, y = as.factor(round(heightIN_MC, 3))), data= dat) +
  geom_smooth(aes(col = female, group = female, 
                  x = weightLB, y = as.factor(round(heightIN_MC, 3))), 
              method = 'lm', se = FALSE, data= dat) +
  labs(y = "HeightLB", x = "WeightLB") +
  theme_classic() +
  coord_flip()
```

## Assessing Distributional Assumptions Graphically

```{r}
plot(mod5)
```

## Hypothesis Tests for Normality

If a given test is **significant**, it indicates that your data do not come from a normal distribution

In practice, tests will often provide conflicting information. The best way to evaluate normality is to consider both plots and tests together (approximate normality is usually sufficient)

```{r}
shapiro.test(mod5$residuals)
```

## Wrapping Up

-   Today was an introduction to mathematical statistics as a way to understand the implications statistical models make about data

-   Although many of these topics do not seem directly relevant, they help provide insights that untrained analysts may not easily attain
