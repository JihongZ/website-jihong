# Course Overview

Welcome to **ESRM 64103: Experimental Design in Education**. This course is designed to strengthen your ability to analyze and interpret research data using analysis-of-variance (ANOVA) techniques. Building on your foundation from ESRM 64003 (*Educational Statistics and Data Processing*), you will gain skills essential for advanced ESRM coursework.Prerequisites: ESRM 64003 (*Educational Statistics and Data Processing*) or an equivalent course with a grade of C or better.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

-   Select appropriate statistical techniques based on research methods and questions.
-   Understand the factors that influence the statistics discussed in class.
-   Use the R language to display data and conduct statistical analyses.
-   Apply both descriptive and inferential methods to analyze empirical data.
-   Interpret, write, and discuss results in accordance with APA format.
-   Develop a conceptual understanding of each method, enabling you to apply and interpret statistical techniques appropriately and creatively.

*Note: This is not a mathematics course, but a strong conceptual grasp of the methods is essential for meaningful application and interpretation.*



## Course Topics
Topics covered in this course include:

-   Overview of ANOVA Designs
-   Model Comparison: Two-Group Situation and One-Way Designs
-   Tests of Single and Multiple Comparisons
-   Two-Way Between-Subjects Factorial Designs
-   Interactions and Simple Main Effects
-   One-Way and Multiple Way Within-Subjects Designs
-   Designs with Both Between-Subjects and Within-Subjects Factors

## Attendance

Attendance is expected at the graduate level. If you know you will be out of town when an assignment is due, please make arrangements to complete and submit your work in advance. Deadlines are set to provide the maximum allowable time for completion.

# Assignments

## Homework

Homework assignments are designed for both instructional and assessment purposes. Each homework will be assigned approximately every two weeks and will consist of questions related to course content, including material from lectures and computer-based exercises. **You are strongly encouraged to complete and submit each homework by the specified due date via the online Homework Portal (see [Homework portal](#sec-homeworkportal)).** Timely submission is essential for staying on track with the course schedule.

## Grading Criteria

This is a graduate-level course. Students are expected to read assigned textbook chapters and lecture notes, attend all in-person classes, complete all assignments thoroughly, and actively participate in class activities. Consistent engagement in these activities is typically associated with successful course performance. Grades will be determined according to the following point system:

|               | Raw Score | Percentage |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Homework      | 80        | 80%        |
| In-Class Quiz | 20        | 20%        |
| Bonus Points  | 2         | —          |
| **Total**     | **102**   | **100%**   |

: Grading Breakdown

The grading scale for this course is as follows:

| Percentage of Points | Grade |

## AI Statement

Specific permissions will be provided to students regarding the use of generative artificial intelligence tools on certain graded activities in this course. In these instances, I will communicate explicit permission as well as expectations and any pertinent limitations for use and attribution. Without this permission, the use of generative artificial intelligence tools in any capacity while completing academic work submitted for credit, independently or collaboratively, will be considered academic dishonesty and reported to the Office of Academic Initiatives and Integrity.
