<span style="font-family:'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif; font-weight: 600;">About Me</span>

I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of [Educational Statistics and Research Methods](https://esrm.uark.edu/directory/uid/jzhang/name/Jihong+Zhang/) in the Department of Counseling, Leadership, and Research Methods, at the University of Arkansas. I'm also a faculty affiliate with the [Center for Public Health & Technology Research](https://publichealthtech-center.uark.edu) at the University of Arkansas. My research program advances modern psychometric methodology while bridging educational measurement, behavioral science, and data science.

My work focuses on two synergistic strands of methodological development. The first centers on psychological network analysis, including network analysis of EEG data, mental-health symptoms, physical activities, and the examination of dynamic processes in eating disorders. The second explores AI-powered psychometrics, including interview-informed large language models for survey response generation, machine-learning–based equating and assessment design, and emerging multi-agent systems supporting human–AI collaboration in educational decision-making.
