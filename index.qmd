<span style="font-family:'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif; font-weight: 600;">About Me</span>

I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of [Educational Statistics and Research Methods](https://esrm.uark.edu/directory/uid/jzhang/name/Jihong+Zhang/) in the Department of Counseling, Leadership, and Research Methods, and a faculty affiliate with the [Center for Public Health & Technology Research](https://publichealthtech-center.uark.edu) at the University of Arkansas. My research program advances modern psychometric methodology while bridging educational measurement, behavioral science, and computational innovation.

My work focuses on two synergistic strands of methodological development. The first centers on psychological network analysis, including applications to EEG data, longitudinal modeling of mental-health symptoms, physical activities, and the examination of dynamic processes in eating disorders. The second explores AI-enabled psychometrics, including interview-informed large language models for survey response generation, machine-learning–based equating and assessment design, and emerging multi-agent systems supporting human–AI collaboration in educational decision-making.

Beyond these core areas, I contribute to the advancement of Bayesian latent variable modeling and related techniques such as factor analysis, diagnostic classification models, generalizability theory, and structural equation modeling. Across these methods, I am also interested in the integration of rigorous quantitative approaches with impactful applications in education and clinical psychology spanning inclusive education, learning disabilities, motivation, mathematics anxiety, and behavioral-health outcomes.

Through ongoing partnerships in education, psychology, and technology, my work aims to shape the future of psychometrics by enhancing the validity, interpretability, and practical utility of assessment in real-world contexts—whether in classrooms, clinical settings, or digitally mediated environments.
