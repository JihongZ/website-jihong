::: {#hero-heading .nice-paragraph}
I currently hold the position of [Assistant Professor of Educational Statistics and Research Methods](https://esrm.uark.edu/directory/uid/jzhang/name/Jihong+Zhang/) (ESRM) at the department of Counseling, Leadership, and Research Methods (CLRM), University of Arkansas. Previously, I served as a postdoctoral fellow at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in the department of Social Work. My academic journey in psychometrics starts with a doctoral training with [Dr. Jonathan Templin](https://jonathantemplin.com/) in the Educational Measurement and Statistics (EMS) program at the University of Iowa. My primary research recently focuses on reliability and validation of psychological network, Bayesian latent variable modeling, Item Response Theory modeling, and other advanced psychometric modeling. My expertise lies in the application of advanced statistical modeling in the fields of psychology and education, including multilevel modeling and structural equation modeling. My work is characterized by a commitment to enhancing the methodological understanding and application of statistics in educational research and beyond.
