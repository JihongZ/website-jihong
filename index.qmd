[About Me]{.mt2 .mb0 .baskerville .i .fw6 .f4}

I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Educational Statistics and Research Methods ([ESRM](https://esrm.uark.edu/directory/uid/jzhang/name/Jihong+Zhang/)) at the department of Counseling, Leadership, and Research Methods (CLRM), University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, U.S.

Previously, I served as a postdoctoral fellow at the Chinese University of Hong Kong ([CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk)) in the department of Social Work. My academic journey in psychometrics starts with a doctoral training with [Dr. Jonathan Templin](https://jonathantemplin.com/) in the Educational Measurement and Statistics (EMS) program at the University of Iowa. I have rich experience in educational assessment. In my master program at University of Kansas, I worked as a research assisstant in [Kansas Assessment Program](https://ksassessments.org) (KAP) for 3 years. I joined many assessment programs such as Dynamic Learning Maps (DLM). Later in my PhD program, I had the intern in the [Stanford Research Institute](https://www.sri.com) (SRI) focusing on the digital learning of students in the computerized testing.

My primary research focuses on empirical and methodological studies on psychological/psychometric network modeling, Bayesian latent variable modeling, Item Response Theory modeling, and other advanced psychometric modeling. My expertise lies in the application of advanced statistical modeling in the fields of psychology and education.
