This post shows case one example of new package â€“ `litedown` from Yihui Xie. Please refer to the [documentation](https://yihui.org/litedown) for more details.

## Including Plots Here

You can also embed plots now, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
library(tidyverse)
```

Below is not a code chunk but verbatim content
inside a fenced code block (with four backticks).

```{r}
1 + 1
```

Inline code expressions like `{r} 1+1` are not
parsed, either.
