## A minimal example

```` md
Define the radius as `x`:

```{r}
x = 1 + 1
```

When the radius is `{r} x`, the area will be `{r} pi * x^2`.
````

The above code will be output as:

Define the radius as `x`:

```{r}
x = 1 + 1
```

When the radius is `{r} x`, the area will be `{r} pi * x^2`.

## Including Plots Here

You can also embed plots now, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
library(tidyverse)
```

```` md
Below is not a code chunk but verbatim content
inside a fenced code block (with four backticks).

```{r}
1 + 1
```

Inline code expressions like `{r} 1+1` are not
parsed, either.
