![A screenshot of files for Project](directory.png){width="800"}

A great file management is important when revisiting project file when getting feedback from reviewers. I created a R file to generate the folders required for a project. Typically, I follow following step:

1.  Create a empty folder in your project file "Project A"
2.  Open rstudio, `File` \> `New Project ...` then select `Project A`, you should find a `.Rproj` file in the folder. Open it.
3.  Then, create a new R file named "InitializeProject.R", then copy and run following codes in the file.
4.  Finnally, you should have similar folders in `Project A`

```{r filename="InitializeProject.R"}
#| eval: false
if(!require(fs)) {
  install.packages("fs")
}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(fs))

getwd()

folders <- c(
  "00_Code",# for R/Stan/Python syntax files
  "01_OriginalData", # for original data
  "02_TransformedData", # for transformed data, intermedian data
  "03_Figure", # for output figure
  "03_Table", # for output table (.csv)
  "04_Modeling", # sometimes model results are large (MCMC), for models' results
  "05_Manuscript",  # for ppt, pdf, word
  "97_Reference", # for pdf files which have tutorials
  "98_TempData" # for temporate files which will not be used 
)

fs::dir_create(
  path = folders
)

# Library Load
library_load <- function(){
  if(!require(pacman)){install.packages("pacman")}
  pacman::p_load(
    "tidyverse",
    "modeltime",
    "psychonetrics"
  )
}


lib_funs <- "library_load"
dump(
  list = lib_funs,
  file = "00_Code/library_load.R"
)
```
