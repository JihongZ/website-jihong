## Minimal Example

```{r}
#| echo: false
source("library_load.R")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
centrality <- function(x) {
  qgraph::centralityTable(x, standardized = TRUE) |> 
  select(node:value) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = measure, values_from = value)
}
mykbl <- function(x){
  kable(x, digits = 3)
}
```

```{r}
exp1 <- matrix(c(
  0, .8, .5,
  .8, 0, 0.1,
  .5, .1, 0
), nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = T)
rownames(exp1) = colnames(exp1) = c("A", "B", "C")
qgraph::qgraph(input = exp1, edge.labels=T, edge.label.cex = 1.7, edge.label.color = "black")
```

The centrality measures for three nodes:

```{r}
mykbl(centrality(exp1))
```

Assume that there are two individuals with different scores on three items:

```{r}
response <- data.frame(
  A = c(1, 5),
  B = c(1, 1),
  C = c(5, 1)
)
rownames(response) <- c("Person1", "Person2")
mykbl(response)
```

We can calculate the weighted network scores for them based on Strength centrality measures and their item scores

```{r}
as.matrix(response) %*% centrality(exp1)[['Strength']] |> mykbl()
```

The strength-based network score reflect one's **overall level of clusters of nodes in a network**.
