@. Use network analysis to examine Testlet effect.
@. Apply the network analysis to self-reported variables in the mediation task?
@. Diagnosis individuals (yes of no) in the network analysis?
@. Develop ranking factor scores for factor analysis (Authors: Ji L., Xinya L., Jihong Z.)
@. Compare item selection performance for regularized factor analysis and network analysis. (Authors: Jiayin C., Xinya L., Jihong Z.)
@. Apply cross-section network analysis to after-school staffs' physical activity. (Authors: Anqi D., Jihong Z.)
@. Apply longitudinal network analysis to EEG data of mediation task (Authors: Yanli (Jeff) Lin, Jihong Z.)

### Large Language Models in Education
@. Test psychometric difference between LLM-generated and human-generated using measurement invariance.
@. Use LLM to convert interview data into survey response (Jihong Z., Nicole Bonge)
@. Test the stability of LLM-generated survey responses under different conditions (Xinya L., Jihong Z.)
@. Training Generated AI algorithm using large education item pools (Hong Jiao, Xinya L., Jihong Z.).
