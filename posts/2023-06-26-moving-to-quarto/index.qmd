> Since June 25, 2023, I start to move my website from hugo/rmarkdown/blogdown/wowchemy to quarto website. It is difficult to explain why I spend so much time on that. Perhaps because some reasons same as other bloggers:
>
> \(1\) Quarto is the next generation of rmarkdown.
>
> \(2\) Quarto is independent with R or Rstudio.
>
> \(3\) Quarto has a clean file tree for website building.
>
> \(4\) Quarto has cleaner command than hugo (i.e., \`quarto publish netlify\` for publishing website etc.).
>
> This blog serves as a note how I customize quarto website bit by bit. It will not be a comprehensive tutorial (much online resources exists) but contain be some tricks.

## Useful links

1.  Quarto official documentation is always the best place to starts with.

2.  Nicola Rennie's blog is very inspiring. Nice font setting and background. I feel like [Hugo Apéro](https://github.com/hugo-apero/) is the best hugo theme in the market.

3.  Yihui's blog. As the creator of blogdown, Yihui talked about why not transfer to Quarto :P I am a old player of hugo/blogdown, but I am not good at customizing the website from the scratch. Thus, quarto suits my needs very well. For those who is very experienced at JS, hugo is still a better choice.

## Tricks of Quarto

### Code highlighting

The very first trick is using `format > html > code-fold: true` settings in YAML metadata in *\_quarto.yml* (global) or *.qmd* (local) to hide the code block as `|> Code`, like:

```{r}
library(kableExtra)
kbl(head(iris)) |> 
  kable_styling(
    html_font = "Ysabeau Office",
    font_size = 11, full_width = TRUE)
```

Note that the code block can be numbered and added with a left border using `code-block-bg: true` and `code-block-border-left: "#31BAE9"`

Code block now also can be shown with language `#| echo: fenced`. As the code chunk shown below, `{r}` is explicitly presented. I don't hate `#|` as the new way of chuck option setup but when I test the code chuck, I found there is a space between `#|` and option keys. For example, it should be `#| echo: fenced` rather than `#|echo:fenced`. Otherwise, quarto will ignore chunk options.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: false
kableExtra::kbl(head(iris)) |> 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(
    html_font = "Ysabeau Office",
    bootstrap_options = c('striped', 'hover'),
    font_size = 10, full_width = TRUE)
```

```{python}
#| echo: fenced
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: show
import numpy as np
iris = np.array(iris)
```

### Visual model

Visual model is one of the most appealing feature for Quarto but I am far from a expert in that. It looks like a visual model version of markdown editor (so called WYSIWYM editing, What you see is What you mean) but slightly different. The shortcut of switching between source and visual model is `Cmd` + `Shift` + `F4` (Thanks to Yihui's [JS](https://yihui.org/en/2023/02/key-buttons/) for pretty keyboard styling).

I list some most frequently used keyboard for visual mode editing:

(a) Insert Hyperlink: `Cmd` + <kbd>K</kbd>

(b) Add footnote[^1]: `Shift`+`Cmd`+`F7`

(c) Insert picture: `Shift` +`Cmd` +<kbd>I</kbd>

(d) Insert code chunk[^2]: `Alt` +`Cmd` +<kbd>I</kbd>

(e) Edit attribute[^3]: `F4`

[^1]: Like this.

[^2]: By default, it will insert R code chunk. If another language is frequently, use `Tools > Modify keyboard shortcuts > filter 'Insert'`. There should be a place for setting shortcut for other language.

[^3]: Click \`F4\` in any place in the div works.

Please also refer to the [official document](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/vscode/) for more shortcuts and features. One thing I found very interesting is single quote mark `` ` `` . First, I'm not sure how to escape this in visual model. Second, if you close quote before typing content, like \`\`, visual mode will escape both quote marks. However, if you type in left quote mark then content and then close quote (i.e., type in\``something` first, and type closing quote mark), it can quote content correctly.

Last but not least, perhaps just type `/` in rstudio is a better choice as it will pop up a list of elements to choose.

### giscus comments box light/dark toggle

giscus comments box needs some tweaks to switch light/dark based on the toggle switcher of quarto. Please find [Ella's post](https://ellakaye.co.uk/posts/2022-12-11_welcome-quarto/#giscus-comments-box-lightdark-toggle) and [Ella's giscus issue discussion](https://github.com/giscus/giscus/issues/336#issuecomment-1214401296) and [original Javascript](https://github.com/giscus/giscus/issues/336#issuecomment-1214366281).

```{html, filename="giscus-mode-toggle.html"}
<script>
function getGiscusTheme() {
  const quartoTheme = localStorage.getItem("quarto-color-scheme");
  const giscusTheme = quartoTheme === "alternate" ? "dark" : "light";
  return giscusTheme;
}

function setGiscusTheme() {
  function sendMessage(message) {
    const iframe = document.querySelector('iframe.giscus-frame');
    if (!iframe) return;
    iframe.contentWindow.postMessage({ giscus: message }, 'https://giscus.app');
  }
  sendMessage({
    setConfig: {
      theme: getGiscusTheme(),
    },
  });
}

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
  const giscusAttributes = {
    "src": "https://giscus.app/client.js",
    "data-repo": "[ENTER REPO HERE]",
    "data-repo-id": "[ENTER REPO ID HERE]",
    "data-category": "[ENTER CATEGORY NAME HERE]",
    "data-category-id": "[ENTER CATEGORY ID HERE]",
    "data-mapping": "pathname",
    "data-strict": "0",
    "data-reactions-enabled": "1",
    "data-emit-metadata": "0",
    "data-input-position": "top",
    "data-theme": getGiscusTheme(),
    "data-lang": "en",
    "crossorigin": "anonymous",
    "async": "",
  };

  // Dynamically create script tag
  const giscusScript = document.createElement("script");
  Object.entries(giscusAttributes).forEach(([key, value]) => giscusScript.setAttribute(key, value));
  document.body.appendChild(giscusScript);

  // Update giscus theme when theme switcher is clicked
  const toggle = document.querySelector('.quarto-color-scheme-toggle');
  if (toggle) {
    toggle.addEventListener('click', setGiscusTheme);
  }
});
</script>
```

```{html, filename="div-giscus.html"}
<div class="giscus">
```

```{yaml, filename="_metadata.yml"}
include-in-header: giscus-mode-toggle.html
include-after-body: div-giscus.html
