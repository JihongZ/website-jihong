> Recently, I was asked by my friend why should we use Measurement Invariance in real research. Why not just ignore this complex and tedious process? As far I'm concerned, measurement invariance should be widely used if you have large data scale and figure out what's going on between groups difference. In this post, I want to elaborate some problems in **Measurement Invariance**: 1) What is measurement invariance 2) why should we care about measurement invariance 3) how to do measurement invariance using R `Lavaan` Package.

# What is Measurement Invariance (MI)?

In my advisor Jonathan's lectures slide, MI is a testing tool for investigating "whether indicators measure the same construct in the same way in different groups or over time/condition". If so, the indicator response should depend only on latent trait scores.

It is a neat and clear definition of MI. In my opinion, we should first know different piles of variances of indicator responses. We know that in CFA, latent trait is identified by covariances among indicators. Imaging your items responses have significant group difference (male with female, international students with native speaker), there are at least three sources of distinct:

(I start from 0 numbering because I love Python!)

(0) the measurement measure different traits for groups

(1) the difference of true latent trait ($\theta$)

(2) the difference of effects of trait on measurements ($\lambda$).

The zero and first are easy to understand. For international math assessment, it may measure native speaker's math ability but on the other hand measures English proficiency of international students.Or if male and female have different math ability, they might (not must) have different item responses on math assessment.

The final group difference means, even if male and females have exactly same level of trait, they will still have different item responses since same item reflect efficiently or not efficiently the latent trait for male and female. For example, one item of Daily Living Ability Survey is "How often do you cook in a week?". The item may be biased toward men, because most males may hate cooking but still have high daily living ability (such as driving, fixing), some females loving cooking but have low daily living ability. Thus, this item doesn't account for female's or men's daily ability at same extent.

Actually all parameters in CFA model (factor variances, factor covariance, factor means, factor loadings, item intercepts and residential variances, co-variances) could be different for different groups. Testing the difference coming from factor part is called Structural invariance. Testing the difference coming from measurement part is called Measurement Invariance. In previous paragraph, the 0st and 1st differences are measured by Structural Invariance. The 3rd differences are measured by Measurement Invariance.

## An example of Multiple Group CFA Invariance:

This example data is from Brown Chapter 7. Major Depression Criteria across Men and Women (n =345)

9 items rated by clinicians on a scale of 0 to 8 (0=none, 8 =very severely disturbing/disabling)

1.  Depressed mood
2.  Loss of interest in usual activities
3.  Weight/appetite change
4.  Sleep disturbance
5.  Psychomotor agitation/retardation
6.  Fatigue/loss of energy
7.  Feelings of worthless/guilt
8.  Concentration difficulties
9.  Thoughts of death/suicidality

Jonathan in his Measurement Invariance Example elaborated the manual version so that learner could learn what you are doing first. I will show you how to use shortcuts.

### Data Import

```{r packages, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(lavaan)
# library(semPlot)
library(knitr)
# library(kableExtra)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
mddAll = read.table(file = "MDDALL.dat", header = FALSE, 
                    quote = "", na.strings = "99999")

# use dim() to check the dimensions of data
# there are 750 rows and 10 columns

head(mddAll) # check the first several rows of data

colnames(mddAll) = c("sex", paste0("item",1:9)) # assign names, first col is sex, another 9 are items

#recoding sex to specify each group name, set it as factors
mddAll$sex <- mddAll$sex %>% 
  as.factor() %>% 
  recode(`0` = "Female", `1` = "Male", .default = levels(mddAll$sex))

# stardard deviation
# dat1.sd <- as.vector(data[2,]) %>% as.numeric()
# dat2.sd <- as.vector(data[19,]) %>% as.numeric()
# dat1.cov <- cor2cov(R = dat1, sds = dat1.sd) %>% as.matrix()
# dat2.cov <- cor2cov(R = dat2, sds = dat2.sd) %>% as.matrix()

```

The sample size of female reference groups is as same as the male. The model for 2 groups should be same and check how many changes are allowed to differ.

### Model Specification

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
model1.config <- "
# Constrain the factor loadings and intercepts of marker variable in ALL groups
# depress =~ c(L1F, L1M)*item1 + c(L2F, L2M)*item2 + c(L3F, L3M)*item3 +
#            c(L4F, L4M)*item4 + c(L5F, L5M)*item5 + c(L6F, L6M)*item6 + 
#            c(L7F, L7M)*item7 + c(L8F, L8M)*item8 + c(L9F, L9M)*item9
depress =~ item1 + item2 + item3 +
           item4 + item5 + item6 + 
           item7 + item8 + item9

#Item intercepts all freely estimated in both groups with label for each group
item1 ~ 1; item2 ~ 1; item3 ~ 1; 
item4 ~ 1; item5 ~ 1; item6 ~ 1; 
item7 ~ 1; item8 ~ 1; item9 ~ 1;

#Redidual variances all freely estimated with label for each group
item1 ~~ item1; item2 ~~ item2; item3 ~~ item3; 
item4 ~~ item4; item5 ~~ item5; item6 ~~ item6; 
item7 ~~ item7; item8 ~~ item8; item9 ~~ item9;

#Residual covariance freely estimated in both groups with label for each group
item1 ~~ item2

#==================================================
#Factor variance fixed to 1 for identification in each group
depress ~~ c(1,NA)*depress

#Factor mean fixed to zero for identification in each group
depress ~ c(0,NA)*0
"
```

### Model Options

Configural Invariance Model is the first-step model which allows all estimation different for two groups except that mean and variance of factor are fixed to 0 and 1, because the model uses z-score scalling.

Compared to configural invariance, metic invariance model constrains the factor loadings for two groups equal with each other. To test metric invariance, we could use absolute model fit indices (CFI, TLI, RMSEA, SRMR) and comparable model fit indices (Log-likelihood test). It deserves noting that in metric invariance model, factor means are still constrained to be equal for two groups but the variances of factor are different. The variance of factor for reference group is fixed to 1 but that for other group is free to estimate. Since if we constrain both factor loadings and factor variances to equal, then the residual variances of items will also be equal. This is next step. Freeing one group's factor variance will let model not too strict to Residual Variance.

Next model is Scalar Invariance Model, which constrain the intercepts of items to be equal.
