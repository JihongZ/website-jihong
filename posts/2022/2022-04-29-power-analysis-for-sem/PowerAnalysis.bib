	abstract = {Despite the widespread and rising popularity of structural equation modeling ({SEM}) in psychology, there is still much confusion surrounding how to choose an appropriate sample size for {SEM}. Currently available guidance primarily consists of sample-size rules of thumb that are not backed up by research and power analyses for detecting model misspecification. Missing from most current practices is power analysis for detecting a target effect (e.g., a regression coefficient between latent variables). In this article, we (a) distinguish power to detect model misspecification from power to detect a target effect, (b) report the results of a simulation study on power to detect a target regression coefficient in a three-predictor latent regression model, and (c) introduce a user-friendly Shiny app, {pwrSEM}, for conducting power analysis for detecting target effects in structural equation models.},

	doi = {10.1037/met0000423},
	abstract = {Structural equation modeling ({SEM}) is a widespread approach to test substantive hypotheses in psychology and other social sciences. However, most studies involving structural equation models neither report statistical power analysis as a criterion for sample size planning nor evaluate the achieved power of the performed tests. In this tutorial, we provide a step-by-step illustration of how a priori, post hoc, and compromise power analyses can be conducted for a range of different {SEM} applications. Using illustrative examples and the R package {semPower}, we demonstrate power analyses for hypotheses regarding overall model fit, global model comparisons, particular individual model parameters, and differences in multigroup contexts (such as in tests of measurement invariance). We encourage researchers to yield reliable—and thus more replicable—results based on thoughtful sample size planning, especially if small or medium-sized effects are expected.
