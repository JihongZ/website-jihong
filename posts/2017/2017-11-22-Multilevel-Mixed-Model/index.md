> Recently I'm coming across with one problem. If data set only contains two time points, is it still possible to  use multilevel mixed model (MLM)?

# What is Multilevel Mixed Model?

There're 2 ways deal with longitudinal data: (1) multilevel linear model (2) structural equation model. 

## Longitudinal Data Set

In Dr. Hoffman's lectures, she explained "Longitudinal" Data as some individual units of analysis measured at different occasions. Requirements for longitudinal data includes at least 2 outcomes from same sampling unit (e.g. person), but only 2 outcomes can lead to problems. When only 1 difference of outcomes (2 waves) is observable, it can't distinguish "real" individual differences in change from error. **In other words, in this condition, within-person residual error is just difference between 2 observations.** However, repeated measures ANOVA is just fine for 2 observations.
