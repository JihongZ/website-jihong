As contributors of the R package said in their [github website](https://github.com/ModelOriented/forester):

> "The *forester* package is **an AutoML tool in R** that wraps up all machine learning processes into a single `train()` function, which includes:"

-   rendering a brief **data check** report,
-   **preprocessing** initial dataset enough for models to be trained,
-   **training** 5 tree-based models with default parameters, random search and Bayesian optimization,
-   **evaluating** them and providing a ranked list.

In this blog, I will introduce `forester` package as a case study using a simulation example and a real example.

```{mermaid}

    A[data check]-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

## Useful links

-   One of the contributor, Hubert Ruczynski, wrote up a detailed [tutorial](https://medium.com/responsibleml/forester-predicting-house-prices-use-case-b537253b6142) published in Mar 1, 2023.

## An example

First of all, `forester::check_data` is a very convenient function to glimpse the data for data analysis. By default it will output a "CHECK DATA REPORT", including some data quality checking list, meanwhile it will also do Spearman correlations.

```{r}
check_dat_res <- forester::check_data(iris, 'Species')
```

```{r}
str(check_dat_res$str)
```
