> This post is aimed to introduce the basics of using jags in R programming. Jags is a frequently used program for conducting Bayesian statistics.Most of information below is borrowed from [Jeromy Anglim’s Blog](http://jeromyanglim.blogspot.com/2012/04/getting-started-with-jags-rjags-and.html). I will keep editing this post if I found more resources about jags.

## What is JAGS?
JAGS stands for Just Another Gibbs Sampler. To quote the program author, Martyn Plummer, "It is a program for analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation..." It uses a dialect of the BUGS language, similar but a little different to OpenBUGS and WinBUGS.

## Installation 
To run jags with R, There is an interface with R called `rjags`.
1. [Download and install Jags](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/) based on your operating system.
2. Install additional R packages: type `install.packages(c(“rjags”,”coda”))` in R console. `rjags` is to interface with JAGS and `coda` is to process MCMC output.

## JAGS Examples
There are a lot of examples online. The following provides links or simple codes to JAGS code.

- Justin Esarey
	- An entire course on [Bayesian Statistics](http://jee3.web.rice.edu/teaching.htm) with examples in R and JAGS. It includes 10 lectures and each lecture lasts around 2 hours. The content is designed for a social science audience and it includes a syllabus linking with Simon Jackman's text. The videos are linked from above or available direclty on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAFC5F02F224FA59F).

- Jeromy Anglim
	- The author of this blog also provides a few examples. He shared the codes on his [github account](https://github.com/jeromyanglim)
- John Myles White
	- A course on statistical models that is under development with [JAGS scripts on github](https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/JAGSExamples).
	- [Simple introductory examples of fitting a normal distribution, linear regression, and logistic regression](http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/2010/08/20/using-jags-in-r-with-the-rjags-package/)
	- A follow-up post demonstrating the use of the coda package with rjags to perform [MCMC diagnostics](http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/2010/08/29/mcmc-diagnostics-in-r-with-the-coda-package/).
- A simple simulation sample:
```{r setup, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# close echo until you want to echo your codes.
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

First, simulate the Data: 
```{r }
library(R2jags)
n.sim <- 100; set.seed(123)
x1 <- rnorm(n.sim, mean = 5, sd = 2)
x2 <- rbinom(n.sim, size = 1, prob = 0.3)
e <- rnorm(n.sim, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

Next, we create the outcome y based on coefficients $b_1$ and $b_2$ for the respective predictors and an intercept a:
```{r }
b1 <- 1.2
b2 <- -3.1
a <- 1.5
y <- b1*x1 + b2*x2 + e
```

Now, we combine the variables into one dataframe for processing later:
```{r}
sim.dat <- data.frame(y, x1, x2)
```

And we create and summarize a (frequentist) linear model fit on these data:
```{r}
freq.mod <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = sim.dat)
summary(freq.mod)
```

### Beyesian Model
```{r}
bayes.mod <- function() {
 for(i in 1:N){
 y[i] ~ dnorm(mu[i], tau)
 mu[i] <- alpha + beta1 * x1[i] + beta2 * x2[i]
 }
 alpha ~ dnorm(0, .01)
 beta1 ~ dunif(-100, 100)
 beta2 ~ dunif(-100, 100)
 tau ~ dgamma(.01, .01)
}
```

Now define the vectors of the data matrix for JAGS:
```{r}
y <- sim.dat$y
x1 <- sim.dat$x1
x2 <- sim.dat$x2
N <- nrow(sim.dat)
```

Read in the data frame for JAGS
```{r}
sim.dat.jags <- list("y", "x1", "x2", "N")
```

Define the parameters whose posterior distributions you are interested in summarizing later:
```{r}
bayes.mod.params <- c("alpha", "beta1", "beta2")
```

Setting up starting values
```{r}
bayes.mod.inits <- function(){
 list("alpha" = rnorm(1), "beta1" = rnorm(1), "beta2" = rnorm(1))
}

# inits1 <- list("alpha" = 0, "beta1" = 0, "beta2" = 0)
# inits2 <- list("alpha" = 1, "beta1" = 1, "beta2" = 1)
# inits3 <- list("alpha" = -1, "beta1" = -1, "beta2" = -1)
# bayes.mod.inits <- list(inits1, inits2, inits3)
```

### Fitting the model
```{r ,message=TRUE}
set.seed(123)
bayes.mod.fit <- jags(data = sim.dat.jags, inits = bayes.mod.inits,
  parameters.to.save = bayes.mod.params, n.chains = 3, n.iter = 9000,
  n.burnin = 1000, model.file = bayes.mod)
```

### Diagnostics
```{r}
print(bayes.mod.fit)
```

```{r , results='asis'}
plot(bayes.mod.fit)
```

```{r, results='asis'}
traceplot(bayes.mod.fit)
```
