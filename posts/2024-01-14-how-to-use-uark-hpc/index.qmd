## General Information

Arkansas High Performance Computing Center (AHPCC) is available for research and instructional use to faculty and students of any Arkansas university and their research collaborators. There is no charge for use of our computing resources.

To use the HPC, an AHPCC account must be requested through [Internal Account Request Form](http://hpc.uark.edu/hpc-support/user-account-requests/internal.php). Please see [here](https://dartproject.org/hpc/) for more information about AHPPC inventory.

## Connect to HPC

As long as you have an AHPCC account, you can connect to HPC through SSH. For Windows users, you can use [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) to connect to HPC. For Mac and Linux users, you can use the terminal to connect to HPC. The command is:

``` bash
ssh [loginname]@hpc-portal2.hpc.uark.edu
```

If your account was successfully setted up, passwords will be required. After you enter your password, you will be connected to HPC.

Note: Pinnacle is a new resource at the University of Arkansas in 2019. It consists of 100 Intel based nodes with 20 NVIDIA V100 GPU nodes enabling data science and machine learning and 8 big memory nodes with 768 Gb ram/each for projects requiring a large memory footprint.

### SSH login without password

1.  Generate a pair of authentication keys in your local machine and do not enter a passphrase using the following codes:

``` bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa   
```

Please note that make the passphrase empty:

```         
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/[username]/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /Users/[username]/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /Users/[username]/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

2.  In your local machine, type in following commands to copy local public key to the hpc server.

``` bash
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub [loginname]@hpc-portal2.hpc.uark.edu:/home/[loginname]/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

3.  Now you should be able to login the hpc login node without password:

``` bash
ssh [loginname]@hpc-portal2.hpc.uark.edu
```

## Moving data

For moving data files from local machine to HPC, type in following codes on your local machine:

``` bash
scp program.c loginname@hpc-portal2.hpc.uark.edu:/home/loginname/
```

To copy an entire directory tree `src` using SCP, use `-r` for recursive:

``` bash
scp -r src loginname@hpc-portal2.hpc.uark.edu:/home/loginname/
```

Similarly, for moving data files from HPC to local machine, type in following codes on your local machine:

``` bash
scp -r loginname@hpc-portal2.hpc.uark.edu:/home/loginname/src ./
```

## Jobs submission

There are multiple steps to submit the R file to cluster to run.

**First**, we need to determine the computing nodes we want to use. Please refer to this [link](https://hpcwiki.uark.edu/doku.php?id=equipment) for detailed information about HPC equipment. A general 'submitting' command is like this:

``` bash
sbatch -q q06h32c -l walltime=1:00 -l nodes=1:ppn=32 example.sh
```

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Note

`sbatch` command aims to submit a job with the job file `example.sh`. The command above submitted the job to the q06h32c queue with a wall-time of 1 minute requesting all 32 cores on 1 node.
:::

**Second**, create a job file with `.sh` extension. Here's a simple example of a job file `example.sh` that can tell HPC **how** to run your R code:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=mpi
#SBATCH --output=zzz.slurm
#SBATCH --partition comp06
#SBATCH --nodes=2
#SBATCH --tasks-per-node=32
#SBATCH --time=6:00:00
module load gcc/11.2.1 mkl/19.0.5 R/4.2.2

Rscript HelloWorld/example.R
```

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Note**

Where <mark>Line 8</mark> loaded all required modules:

-   `gcc` and `mkl` are required for R package installation (Note: To the date, `gcc/11.2.1` is the latest version of `gcc` than can compile the `cmdstanr` successfully). Please see [here](https://hpcwiki.uark.edu/doku.php?id=r) for more details.

-   `Rscript` is the bash command to execute R file on HPC. `HelloWorld/example.R` is the path of your R script.

-   Anything behind the `#SBATCH` are options for the SLURM scheduler. Please see following summary or view [it](https://slurm.schedmd.com/pdfs/summary.pdf) online:
:::

```{r, echo=FALSE}
xfun::embed_file("summary.pdf")
```

**Third**, you may want to use R interactively to test your R code is running well. Use the following bash command to start a brand new R in terminal:

``` bash
srun -N1 -n1 -c1 -p cloud72 -q cloud -t 2:00:00 --pty /bin/bash
```

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Note

This command will redirect to cloud72 queue, which includes virtual machines and containers, usually single processor, 72 hour limit, 3 nodes.

::: callout-note
## Note

For slurm, please use the commands in the 1st column. Then you should be able to start R in an interactive job and install required packages. If you load `R/4.2.2` module, those packages installed via an interactive job will be stored at `$HOME$/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/4.2/`. See [here](https://hpcwiki.uark.edu/doku.php?id=pinnacle_usage) for more details about interactive job.
:::

**Finnally,** the whole workflow of job submission is as follows:

``` bash
c1331:jzhang:~/HelloWorld$ cat exampleJob.sh
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --tasks-per-node=2
#SBATCH --job-name=Exp0
module purge
module load os/el7 gcc/9.3.1 mkl/19.0.5 R/4.2.2
cd $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR
Rscript example.R
c1331:jzhang:~/HelloWorld$ rm slurm-334001.out
c1331:jzhang:~/HelloWorld$ sbatch exampleJob.sh
Submitted batch job 334002
c1331:jzhang:~/HelloWorld$ ls
exampleJob.sh  example.R  gene_up.txt  MS_entrez_id_alldata.txt  slurm-334002.out
c1331:jzhang:~/HelloWorld$
```

## Checking job

``` bash
squeue -u loginname
```

Below shows the information of all running/down task for the queue `comp06` (there are 9 Jobs but only 7 are running). Note that comp06 and comp72 queues share the same nodes, both belonging to pinnacle cluster. There are 49 public standard compute nodes. Thus, if there are 49 running jobs in both queues, then your job has to be waitting until some jobs finished.

For example, below shows all 47 running jobs in comp06/comp72 queues. Some have been running like 2 days. There are 72 hours limit though for all computation nodes.

``` bash
squeue -p comp06,comp72 -t R

```

When you want to get the worst case scenario estimate of when your waiting jobs will start, you can always run following command,

``` bash
squeue -u [loginname] --start
```

### Queues

Most frequently used queues are from `pinnacle` cluster.

Below is a list of queues in the `pinnacle` cluster. The number after the queue is the time limit for a running job. For example, `comp72` has 72 hour limits while `comp06` has only 6 hour limit, but they share same nodes. Thus, for efficiency, maybe use `comp01` for quick examination of coding and use `comp72` for time consuming jobs.

``` bash
comp72/06/01: standard compute nodes, 72/6/1 hour limit, 42/46/48 nodes
gpu72/06:     gpu nodes: 72/6 hour limit, 19 nodes
agpu72/06:    a100 gpu nodes: 72/6 hour limit
himem72/06:   768 GB nodes, 72/6 hour limit, 6 nodes
pubcondo06:   condo nodes all-user use, 6 hour limit, various constraints required, 25 nodes
pcon06:       same as pubcondo06, shortened name for easier printout, use this going forward
cloud72:      virtual machines and containers, usually single processor, 72 hour limit, 3 nodes
condo:        condo nodes, no time limit, authorization required, various constraints required, 25 nodes
tres72/06:    reimaged trestles nodes, 72/06 hour limit, 126 nodes
razr72/06:    reimaged razor nodes, 72 hour limit, in progress
```

Here's some useful information regarding selecting queue from https://hpcwiki.uark.edu/doku.php?id=pinnacle_usage

> Generally the nodes are reserved for the most efficient use, especially for expensive features such as GPU and extra memory. Pinnacle compute nodes are very busy (comp.. and himem.. partitions) are reserved for scalable programs that can use all 32/24 cores (except for the cloud partition, and condo usage by the owner). Cores are allocated by the product of ntasks-per-node x cpus-per-task. Exceptions: (1) serial/single core jobs that use more memory than available on Razor/Trestles (64 to 192 GB) (2) multiple jobs submitted together that use a whole node, such as 4 x 8 cores (3) two jobs on one high-memory node (2 x 12 cores) that each use more than 192 GB (and less than 384 GB so that they can run on the himem node)

### Troubleshooting

1.  Revise `.bashrc` so that the ssh cannot login?

    You potential can try `ctrl+c` to avoid the ssh to execute bashrc. Try multiple time if not succeed. See [here](https://serverfault.com/questions/206544/i-screwed-up-exit-in-bashrc) for reference.
