# Homework 2

## Homework 2: Setup

![Model 1: Diagram of correlation model with perf, use, and mas](hw2_diagram01.png){alt="Model 1: Diagram of correlation model with perf, use, and mas" fig-align="center"}

You can check the detailed rules of path analysis diagram [here](https://websem.psychstat.org/wiki/_media/manual/websem-draw-pathdiagrams.pdf). Some basic rules:

1.  Observed variables: rectangle/square
2.  Latent variables: ellipse/circle
3.  Intercept: triangle shape
4.  Regression relation: single-headed arrow
5.  Correlation/Covariance: double-headed arrow
    1.  Point to itself: residual variance
    2.  Point to others: covariances

## Homework 2: Model 1 - Correlation Model with perf, use, and mas

```{r}
#| output-location: column
model04.syntax = "
# Variances:
perf ~~ perf 
use ~~ use   
mas ~~ mas

# Covariance:
perf ~~ use
perf ~~ mas
use ~~ mas

# Means:
perf ~ 1  
use ~ 1   
mas ~ 1   
"

## Estimation for model01
model04.fit <- cfa(model04.syntax, data=dataMath, mimic="MPLUS", fixed.x = TRUE, estimator = "MLR") 

## Print output
standardizedsolution(model04.fit)

## filter correlations among varaibles
standardizedsolution(model04.fit) |> filter(op == "~~", lhs != rhs)
```

-   For Performance and Usefulness, there is a weak but significantly positive correlation with **r = .158 (.059), p = .007**

-   For Performance and Anxiety, there is a strong and significantly positive correlation with **r = .526 (.043), p \< .001**

-   For Usefulness and Anxiety, there is a moderate and significantly positive correlation with **r = .299 (.049), p \< .001**

## Homework 2: Model 2 - constraining the correlation of use and mas to 0

![Model 2: Constrained model](hw2_diagram02.png){alt="Model 2: Constrained model" fig-align="center"}

```{r}
model04b.syntax = "
# Variances:
perf ~~ perf 
use ~~ use   
mas ~~ mas

# Covariance:
perf ~~ use
perf ~~ mas
use ~~ 0*mas

# Means:
perf ~ 1  
use ~ 1   
mas ~ 1   
"
model04b.fit <- cfa(model04b.syntax, data=dataMath, mimic="MPLUS", fixed.x = TRUE, estimator = "MLR") 

## Print output
standardizedsolution(model04b.fit)

standardizedsolution(model04b.fit) |> filter(op == "~~", lhs != rhs)
```

-   For Performance and Usefulness, there is a weak and non-significantly positive correlation with **r = .017 (.056), p = .765**

-   For Performance and Anxiety, there is a strong and significantly positive correlation with **r = .523 (.044), p \< .001**

-   For Usefulness and Anxiety, there is a zero correlation with **r = 0 (0), p = NA**

## Homework 2: AIC and BIC

```{r}
anova(model04.fit, model04b.fit)
```

-   For Model 1, AIC = 6421.3 and BIC = 6456.0

-   For Model 2, AIC = 6446.5 and BIC = 6477.4

-   According to the criteria of lower AIC/BIC values indicating better model fit and the result of Likelihood ratio test ($\chi^2(0, 1)=29.031, p < .001$), we prefer model 1 as it has significantly better model fit than model 2.
