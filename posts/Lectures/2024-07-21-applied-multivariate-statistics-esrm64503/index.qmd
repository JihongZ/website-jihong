## Course Objectives, Materials, and Pre-Requisites:

The online syllabus at the address provided above will always have the most up-to-date information. Multivariate statistical procedures as applied to educational research settings. Emphasis on use of existing computer statistical packages

This course has two main objectives:

1.  **Modern multivariate analysis using observed variables**
2.  **Build a foundation for terminology, concepts, and software from which participants can eventually learn more advanced analysis.**

This course offers an exploration of multivariate statistics within the context of education and psychology. Class time will be devoted primarily to lectures and examples. Lecture materials in .html format will be available for download and view at the website above the day prior to class, or else paper copies will be provided in class. Audio/Video recordings of the class lectures in .mp4 format will also be posted online upon requested, but are not intended to take the place of class attendance. Selected book chapters and journal articles will be assigned for each specific topic as needed. The initial list of readings is provided below but will likely be updated throughout the semester. Updates to the reading list will be posted in the online syllabus and announced in class and via email. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) language will be the primary statistical tool used throughout the course, with the [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) front end being the user interface.

## Prerequisite

Participants should be familiar with the general linear model (such as analysis of variance, linear regression) prior to enrolling in this course.

Also, it is assumed that students have has solid statistical training up to and including topics in multivariate statistics (ESRM 64103 Experimental Design in Education, and ESRM 64203 Multiple Regression Techniques for Education). In addition, it is assumed you are also familiar with R language. SPSS may not be sufficient for this course.

## How to Be Successful in This Class

-   Come to class ready to learn.
-   Complete the out-of-class exercises prior to each class.
-   If you become confused or don't fully grasp a concept, ask for help from your instructor
-   Know what is going on: keep up with email, course announcements, and the course schedule.
-   Try to apply the information to your area of interest --- if you have a cool research idea, come talk to me!

## Software

-   R and R packages (tidyverse)

# Homework

-   Student evaluation will be made on the basis of **homework grades (84%) and quiz grades (16%)**.

-   Homework (HW) assignments will be posted using **online homework portal** on Wednesday. They will be due by Monday end of work hours of the following week.

-   Short in-class quiz (1-3 questions) will be administrated in the beginning of each class and aim to refresh the memory. Students have 5-10 minutes to answer those questions. The questions will be very general. I recommend you **bring your laptop device or mobile device** in class so that you can answer those in-class quiz.

After everyone finish the quiz, we will review the in-class quiz together.

To make the most of my office hours, please come prepared.

-   In person: This means you should bring printouts and/or your files on a laptop so that we can review them.

-   Electronically: If you have questions about your assignment and cannot make my office hours, you can email me specific and detailed questions. (R code and data set attached to the email)

## Grading

Your grade in this class will be determined based on homework assignment and in class quizzes on the material and required readings. There will be 3 homework assignments. The number of in-class quizzes will be as same as the number of in-person class.

All homework and answers must be your own and not be copied or paraphrased from anyone else's answers. Students will have the opportunity to earn up to **100 total points** in the course. Up to 84 points can be earned from assignments (approximately 28 points for each homework in total). Up to **16 points** may be earned from in-class quizzes on the material and required readings, but students must be present on the day the quiz is administered to earn these points. Please note there will be at least one opportunity to earn up to **10 points of extra credit** (labeled Homework 0 in the online course website).

| Percentage of Points | Grade |
|----------------------|-------|
| 100-90               | A     |
| 89-90                | B     |
| 79-70                | C     |
| 69-60                | D     |
| \< 60                | F     |

## Policy on Late Homework Assignments and Incompletes:

In order to be able to provide the entire class with prompt feedback, late homework assignments will incur a **4-point penalty**. However, extensions may be granted as needed for extenuating circumstances (e.g., conferences, family obligations) if requested at least three weeks in advance of the due date. As noted above, missed in-class quizzes cannot be made up.

# Academic Policies

## AI Statement

Specific permissions will be provided to students regarding the use of generative artificial intelligence tools on certain graded activities in this course. In these instances, I will communicate explicit permission as well as expectations and any pertinent limitations for use and attribution. Without this permission, the use of generative artificial intelligence tools in any capacity while completing academic work submitted for credit, independently or collaboratively, will be considered academic dishonesty and reported to the Office of Academic Initiatives and Integrity.

## Academic Integrity

As a core part of its mission, the University of Arkansas provides students with the opportunity to further their educational goals through programs of study and research in an environment that promotes freedom of inquiry and academic responsibility. Accomplishing this mission is only possible when intellectual honesty and individual integrity prevail.

Each University of Arkansas student is required to be familiar with and abide by the University's **Academic Integrity Policy** at [honesty.uark.edu/policy](https://honesty.uark.edu/policy). Students with questions about how these policies apply to a particular course or assignment should immediately contact their instructor.
