## Simulated Data for Today's Lecture - dataSexHeightWeight

-   To help demonstrate the concepts of today's lecture, we will be using a toy data set with three variables

    -   **Female (Gender)**: Coded as Male (= 0) or Female (= 1)

        -   In R, factor variable with two levels: FALSE, TRUE

    -   **Height**: in inches

    -   **Weight**: in pounds

-   The goal of lecture 02 will be to build a general **linear model** that predicts a person's weight

    -   **Linear (regression) model**: a statistical model for an outcome that uses a linear combination (a weighted sum) of one or more predictor variables to produce an estimate of an observation's predicted value

    -   $$
        \mathbb{y} = \beta_0+\beta_1 \mathbf{X}
        $$

-   All models we learnt today will follow this framework.

## Recoding Variables

```{r}
library(ESRM64503) # INSTALL: pak::pak("JihongZ/ESRM64504")
library(kableExtra) # INSTALL: pak::pak("JihongZ/ESRM64504")

## First checking sample size
## N = 20

## Recode Sex as Female
dataSexHeightWeight$female = dataSexHeightWeight$sex == "F"
kable(dataSexHeightWeight,
      caption = 'toy data set') |> 
  kable_styling(font_size = 30)
```

## Descriptive Statistics

-   First, we can inspect each variable individually (**marginal distribution**) through a set of descriptive statistics

    -   Visual way: histogram plot or density plot

    -   Statistical way: Central tendency and Variability

        -   Mean, Median, Mode

        -   SD, Range

-   Second, we can also summarize the **joint (bivariate) distribution** of two variables through a set of descriptive statistics:

    -   **Joint vs. Marginal**: joint distribution describes more than one variable simultaneously

    -   Common bivariate descriptive statistics:

        -   Correlation and covariance

## Quick inspection: Missing data rate

-   Check (1) if any case has **missing** value (2) **distributions** for continuous and categorical variables

```{r}
#| code-fold: show
#| output-location: column
table(complete.cases(dataSexHeightWeight))

```

```{r}
#| code-fold: show
#| output-location: column
dataWithMissing <- dataSexHeightWeight
dataWithMissing[11, 2] <- NA
table(complete.cases(dataWithMissing))
```

```{r}
#| code-summary: "Distribution of continous variables"
psych::describe(dataSexHeightWeight[,-1], omit = TRUE, trim = 0) |> kable(digits = 3)
```

## Quick Inspect: Distribution of Categorical Variable

```{r}
#| code-summary: "Distribution of categorical variables"
#| output-location: default
table(dataSexHeightWeight$female)
hist(as.numeric(dataSexHeightWeight$female), main = "Histogram of Female", xlab = "Female", )
```

## Visualization: Pairwise Scatterplot

```{r}
#| output-location: default
pairs(dataSexHeightWeight[, c('female', 'heightIN', 'weightLB')])
```

## Histograms of Height and Weight

```{r}
#| output-location: default
#| fig-align: center
hist(dataSexHeightWeight$weightLB, main = 'Weight', xlab = 'Pounds')

hist(dataSexHeightWeight$heightIN, main = 'Height', xlab = 'Inches')
```

## Descriptive Statistics for Toy Data: Marginal

```{r}
library(dplyr)
## wide-format marginal description
wide_marginal_desp <- dataSexHeightWeight |> 
  summarise(across(c(heightIN, weightLB, female), list(mean = mean, sd = sd, var = var)))
```

```{r}
library(tidyr)
wide_marginal_desp |> 
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "Variable", values_to = "Value") |> 
  separate(Variable, sep = "_", into = c("Variable", "Stats")) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Stats, values_from = Value) |> 
  kable(digits = 3)
```

## Descriptive Statistics for Toy Data: Joint

-   **Correlation-Covariance Matrix**:

    -   Diagonal: Variance

    -   Above Diagonal (upper triangle): Covaraince

    -   Below Diagonal (lower triangle): Correlation

-   **Question:** What we can tell regarding the relationships among three variables?

```{r}
cor_cov_mat <- matrix(nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
colnames(cor_cov_mat) <- rownames(cor_cov_mat) <- c("heightIN", "weightLB", "female")
cov_mat <- cov(dataSexHeightWeight[, c("heightIN", "weightLB", "female")])
cor_mat <- cor(dataSexHeightWeight[, c("heightIN", "weightLB", "female")])
## Assign values
cor_cov_mat[lower.tri(cor_cov_mat)] <- cor_mat[lower.tri(cor_mat)]
cor_cov_mat[upper.tri(cor_cov_mat)] <- cov_mat[upper.tri(cov_mat)]
diag(cor_cov_mat) <- diag(cov_mat)
kable(cor_cov_mat, digits = 3)
```

# Variance, Correlation, Covariance

## Re-examining the Concept of Variance

-   Variability is a central concept in advanced statistics

    -   In multivariate statistic, covariance is also central

-   Two formulas for the variance (about the same when $N$ is larger):

    ::: columns
    ::: {.column width="50%"}
    $$
    S^2_Y= \frac{\Sigma_{p=1}^{N}(Y_p-\bar Y)}{N-1}
    $$ {#eq-unbiased-var}
    :::

    ::: {.column width="50%"}
    $$
    S^2_Y= \frac{\Sigma_{p=1}^{N}(Y_p-\bar Y)}{N}$$ {#eq-biased-var}
    :::
    :::

-   @eq-unbiased-var: **Unbiased** or "sample"

-   @eq-biased-var: **Biased/ML** or "population"

Here: $p$ = person;

## Biased VS. Unbiased Variability

```{r}
#| message: false
#| code-fold: show
#| output-location: default
set.seed(1234)
sample_sizes = seq(10, 200, 10) # N = 10, 20, 30, ..., 200
population_var = 100 # True variance for population
variance_mat <- matrix(NA, nrow = length(sample_sizes), ncol = 4)
iter = 0
for (sample_size in sample_sizes) {
  iter = iter + 1
  sample_points <- rnorm(n = sample_size, mean = 0, sd = sqrt(population_var))
  sample_var_biased <- var(sample_points) * (sample_size-1) / sample_size
  sample_var_unbiased <- var(sample_points)
  variance_mat[iter, 1] <- sample_size
  variance_mat[iter, 2] <- sample_var_biased
  variance_mat[iter, 3] <- sample_var_unbiased
  variance_mat[iter, 4] <- population_var
}
colnames(variance_mat) <- c(
  "sample_size",
  "sample_var_biased",
  "sample_var_unbiased",
  "population_var"
)
```

**Take home note**: Unbiased variance estimators can get more accurate estimate of variance than the biased one.

## Biased VS. Unbiased Estimator of Variance (Cont.)

```{r}
#| message: false
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-width: 20
#| output-location: default
library(ggplot2)
variance_mat |> 
  as.data.frame() |> 
  pivot_longer(-sample_size) |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = sample_size, y = value, color = name), linewidth = 1.1) +
  geom_line(aes(x = sample_size, y = value, color = name), linewidth = 1.5) +
  labs(x = "Sample Size (N)", y = "Estimates of Variance") +
  scale_color_manual(values = 1:3, labels = c("Population Variance", "Sample Biased Variance (ML)", "Sample Unbiased Variance"), name = "Estimator") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(10, 200, 10)) + 
  theme_classic() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 25)) 
```

**Take home note**: When sample size is small, unbiased variance estimators can get the estimate of variance closer to the population variance than the biased one.

## Interpretation of Variance

-   The variance ($\sigma^2$ and $S^2$) describes the spread of a variable in **squared units** (which come from $(Y_p - \bar Y)^2$ term in the equation)

-   Variance: **the average squared distance of an observation from the mean**

    -   For the toy sample, the **variance of height** is 55.358 inches squared

    -   For the toy sample, the **variance of weight** is 3179.095 pounds squared

    -   The **variance of female** — not applicable in the same way!

        -   How is the sample equally distributed across different groups: 50/50 -\> largest variance

-   Because squared units are difficult to work with, we typically use the standard deviation – which is reported in units

-   Standard deviation: the average distance of an observation from the mean

    -   SD of Height: 7.44 inches

    -   SD of Weight: 56.383 pounds

## Variance/SD as a More General Statistical Concept

-   Variance (and the standard deviation) is a concept that is applied across statistics – not just for data
    -   Statistical parameters (slope, intercept) have variance
        -   e.g., The sample mean $\bar Y$ has a "standard error" (SE) of $S_{\bar Y} = S_Y / \sqrt{N}$
        -   How accurately we can estimate the sample mean $\neq$ How dispersed the samples are
-   The standard error is another name for standard deviation
    -   So "standard error of the mean" is equivalent to "standard deviation of the mean"
    -   Usually "**error**" refers to **parameters**; "**deviation**" refers to **data**
    -   Variance of the mean would be $S_{\bar Y}^2  = S^2_Y / N$

## Example: Table of Descriptive Statistics

![Table 1 (Xiong et al., 2023)](figures/Exp_Descrip_Stats_Table.png){fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Key information that be reprted

    -   All variables that you think relevant to the study: (1) demographic (2) context factors (3) outcomes or predictors

    -   Categorical Variables: (1) Percentage of each level (2) Sample size of each level (3) Range

    -   Continuous Variables: Mean + SD + Range

## Correlation of Variables

-   Moving from marginal summaries of each variable to joint (bivariate) summaries, we can use the **Pearson Correlation** to describe the association between a pair of **continuous** variables:

$$
r_{Y_1, Y_2} = \frac{\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{p=1}^N (Y_{1p}-\bar Y_1) (Y_{2p}-\bar Y_2)}{S_{Y_1}S_{Y_2}} \\
= \frac{\sum_{p=1}^N (Y_{1p}-\bar Y_1) (Y_{2p}-\bar Y_2)}{\sqrt{\sum_{p=1}^{N} (Y_{1p}-\bar Y)^2}\sqrt{\sum_{p=1}^{N} (Y_{2p}-\bar Y)^2}}
$$

-   **Human words**: how much Variable 1 vary with Variable 2 relative to their own variability.

-   Note that pearson correlation does not take other variables into account

## R: Pearson Correlation

#### Method 1: Use R function

`cor()` function with the argument method = "pearson"

```{r}
#| results: hold
#| code-fold: false
X = 1:10
Y = 10:1
Z = 1:10
cor(X, Y, method = "pearson")
cor(X, Z, method = "pearson")
cor(cbind(X, Y, Z), method = "pearson")
```

#### Method 2: Manual way

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
cor_X_Y = sum((X-mean(X))*(Y-mean(Y)))/(length(X)-1)/(sd(X)*sd(Y))
cor_X_Y
```

-   *sum*() adds up all numbers of vector within the parenthesis

-   X-mean(X) returns the mean centered values of X

-   Two vectors can be multiplied with each other and return a new vector: X\*Y

-   *length*() return the number of values of X

## More on the Correlation Coefficient

-   The Pearson correlation is a **biased** estimator

    -   **Biased estimator**: the expected value differs from the true value for a statistic

-   The unbiased version of correlation estimation would be:

$$
r_{Y_1, Y_2}^U= r_{Y_1,Y_2}(1+\frac{1-r^2_{Y_1,Y_2}}{2N})
$$

-   Properties of biased estimator:

    -   As N gets large bias goes away;

    -   Bias is largest when $r_{Y_1, Y_2} =0$; Pearson Corr. is unbiased when $r_{Y_1, Y_2} =1$

    -   Pearson correlation is an underestimate of true correlation

## Covariance: Association with Units

-   The **numerator** of the Pearson correlation ($r_{Y_1Y_2}$) is the **Covariance**

    -   **Human words**: "Unscaled (Unstandardized)" Correlation

    ::: columns
    ::: {.column width="50%"}
    $$
    S^2_{Y_1, Y_2}= \frac{\sum_{p=1}^{N}(Y_{1p}-\bar Y_1)(Y_{2p}-\bar Y_2)}{N-1}
    $$
    :::

    ::: {.column width="50%"}
    $$
    S^2_{Y_1, Y_2}= \frac{\sum_{p=1}^{N}(Y_{1p}-\bar Y_1)(Y_{2p}-\bar Y_2)}{N}$$
    :::
    :::

-   **Variance is a special Covariance so that the variable covary with itself**

-   The covariance uses the units of the original variables (but now they are multiples):

    -   Covariance of height and weight: 334.832 *inch-pounds*

-   The covariance of a variable with itself is the variance

-   The covariance if often used in multivariate analyses because it ties directly into multivariate distribution

    -   Covariance and correlation are easy to switch between

## Going from Covariance to Correlation

-   If you have the covariance matrix (variances and covariances):

    $$
    r_{Y_1,Y_2}=\frac{S_{Y_1,Y_2}}{S_{Y_1}S_{Y_2}}
    $$

-   If you have the correlation matrix and the standard deviations:

    $$
    S_{Y_1, Y_2} = r_{Y_1, Y_2} S_{Y_1} S_{Y_2}
    $$

## Summary of Unit 1

1.  **Descriptive statistics**: describe central tendency and variability of variables in a visual or statistical way.
    -   Visual way: Histogram, Scatter plot, Density plot
    -   Statistical way: mean/mode/median; variance/standard deviation
2.  **Alternatively**, we cab describe the relationships between two or more variables using their joint distributions
    -   Visual way: Scatter plot, Group-level Histogram
    -   Statistical way: Covariance, Pearson Correlation, Chi-square ($\chi^2$) test 

# Unit 2: General Linear Model

## Learning Objectives

-   Types of distributions:

    -   Conditional distribution: a special joint distribution condition on other variable

-   The General Linear Model

    -   Regression

    -   Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

    -   Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)

    -   Beyond – Interactions

## Taxonomy of GLM

-   The general linear model (GLM) incorporates many different labels of analysis under one unifying umbrella:

|                 | Categorical Xs | Continuous Xs           | Both Types of Xs |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Univariate Y    | ANOVA          | Regression              | ANCOVA           |
| Multivariate Ys | MANOVA         | Multivariate Regression | MANCOVA          |

-   The typical assumption is that error term (residual or $\epsilon$) is normally distribution – meaning that the data are conditionally normally distributed

-   Models for non-normal outcomes (e.g., dichotomous, categorical, count) fall under the *Generalized Linear Model*, of which general linear model is a special case

## Property of GLM: Conditional Normality of Outcome

The general form of GLM with two predictors:

$$
Y_p = {\color{blue}\beta_0+\beta_1X_p+\beta_2Z_p+\beta_3X_pZ_p} + {\color{red}e_p}
$$

-   ::: {style="color: blue;"}
    Model for the Means (Predicted Values):
    :::

    -   Each person's expected (predicted) outcome is a function of his/her values x and z (and their interaction)

    -   y, x, and z are each measured only once per person (*p* subscript)

-   ::: {style="color: red;"}
    Model for the Variance:
    :::

    -   $e_p \sim N(0, \sigma_e^2)$ $\rightarrow$ One residual (unexplained) deviation

    -   $e_p$ has a mean of 0 and variance of $\sigma^2_e$ and is normally distributed, unrelated to x and z, unrelated across observation

    -   Model for the variance is important for **model evaluation**

## Example: Building a GLM for Weight Prediction

-   **Goal**: build a GLM for predicting a person's weight, using height and gender as predictors

-   **Plan**: we proposed several models for didactic reasons — to show how regression and ANOVA work with GLM

    -   In practice, you wouldn't necessarily run these models in this sequence

-   **Beginning model** (Model 1): An **empty model –** no predictors for weight (an **unconditional** model)

-   **Final model** (Model 5): A **full model** – include all predictors and their interaction model

## Example: All models

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Model 1

$$
\hat{ \text{Weight}_p }= \beta_0
$$

-   Model 2:

$$
\hat{\text{Weight}_p} =\beta_0 + \beta_1\text{Height}_p
$$

-   Model 2a:

$$
\hat{\text{Weight}_p} =\beta_0 + \beta_1\text{HeightC}_p
$$
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Model 3:

$$
\hat{\text{Weight}_p}=\beta_0+\beta_2\text{Female}_p
$$

-   Model 4:

$$\hat{\text{Weight}_p}=\beta_0+\beta_1\text{HeightC}_p+\beta_2\text{Female}_p$$

-   Model 5:

$$\hat{\text{Weight}_p}=\beta_0+\beta_1\text{HeightC}_p+\beta_2\text{Female}_p \\ + \beta_3\text{HeigthCxFemale}_p$$
:::
:::

## Model 1: Empty Model

$$
\text{Weight}_p = \beta_0 + e_p
$$ $$
e_p \sim N(0, \sigma^2_e)
$$

-   Estimated parameters:

    -   $\beta_0$: **Overall intercept** - the "grand" mean of weight across all people

    -   $e_p$: **Residual error** - how each one's observes deviate from $\beta_0$

    -   $\sigma^2_e$: **Residual variance** - variability of residual error across all people

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### R Code

```{r}
#| output-location: default
library(ESRM64503)
library(kableExtra)
model1 <- lm(weightLB ~ 1, data = dataSexHeightWeight) # model formula
summary(model1)$coefficients |> kable() # regression cofficients table
anova(model1) |> kable() # F-statistic table
```

-   Interpretation

    -   $\beta_0 = 183.4$ is the predicted value of a Weight for all people is 183.4 pound
        -   Just the mean of weight
    -   $SE(\beta_0) = 12.60$ is the standard error of the mean for weight with higher value suggesting more inaccuracy
    -   $t = 14.55, p < .001$ is t-test of the parameter suggesting the mean of weight significantly deviate from 0
    -   **Error term / Residual**: $\sigma^2_e =  3179.095$ (variance of the residuals)
        -   Equal to the unbiased variance of weight in empty model
        -   Also know as Mean Square Error in F-table

```{r}
#| output-location: default
var(dataSexHeightWeight$weightLB)
var(residuals(model1))
```

## Model 2: Predicting Weight from Height

$$
\text{Weight}_p = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Height}_p + e_p
$$ $$
e_p \sim N(0, \sigma^2_e)
$$

-   Estimated parameters:

    -   $\beta_0$: Intercept - is the predicted value of a Weight for a people with [Height is 0]{style="color: red;"}

    -   $\beta_1$: [Slope of Height]{style="color: red;"} - the predicted increase of Weight for one-unit increase in Height

    -   $e_p$: Residual error - how each one's observes deviate from $\beta_0$

    -   $\sigma^2_e$: Residual variance - variability of residual error across all people

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### R code

```{r}
#| output-location: default
model2 <- lm(weightLB ~ heightIN, data = dataSexHeightWeight) # model formula
summary(model2)$coefficients |> kable(digit = 3) # regression cofficients table
anova(model2) |> kable(digit = 3) # F-statistic table
```

-   Interpretation

    -   $\beta_0 = -227.3$ is the predicted value of a Weight for a people with [Height is 0]{style="color: red;"}
        -   Nonsensical – but we can fix it by [centering Height]{style="color: #ff0040;"}
    -   $\beta_1 = 6.048$: Weight goes up 6.048 per inch
    -   $SE(\beta_1) = 1.076$: the inaccuracy of $\beta_1$; $CI = 6.048 \pm 1.96\times 1.076$
    -   $t = 5.621, p < .001$ is t-test of the parameter suggesting the slope of height significantly deviate from 0
    -   $F(1, 18) = 31.593 = \frac{38479.273}{1217.974} = t^2$
    -   **Error term / Residual**: $\sigma^2_e =  1217.974$ (variance of the residuals)
        -   Height explains $\frac{3179.095-1217.974}{3179.095}=61.7\%$ of variance of weight

## Model 2a: Predicting Weight from [Centered]{style="color: red;"} Height

$$
\text{Weight}_p = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (\text{Height}_p - \bar{Height}) + e_p \\
= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{HeightC}_p + e_p
$$ $$
e_p \sim N(0, \sigma^2_e)
$$

-   Estimated parameters:

    -   $\beta_0$: Intercept - is the predicted value of a Weight for a people with [Height is Mean Height]{style="color: red;"}

    -   $\beta_1$: Slope of Height - the predicted increase of Weight for one-unit increase in Height

    -   $e_p$: Residual error - how each one's observes deviate from $\beta_0$

    -   $\sigma^2_e$: Residual variance - variability of residual error across all people

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### R code

```{r}

-   Interpretation

    -   $\beta_0 = 183.4$ pounds (previously -227.3) is the predicted value of a Weight for a people with [Height is 67.9]{style="color: red;"} inches
    -   Everything except $\beta_0$, $SE(\beta_0)$, and t-value of intercept should be same as the previous model

### Visualization

```{r}
#| output-location: default
#| fig-align: center
ggplot(dataSexHeightWeight) +
  geom_point(aes(x = heightC, y = weightLB)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = heightC, y = weightLB), method = "lm") +

```

## Wrap up: Hypothesis Tests for Parameters

-   To determine if the regression slope is significantly different from zero, we must use a hypothesis test:

$$
H_0: \beta_1 = 0 
$$

$$
H_1: \beta_1 \neq 0
$$

-   We have two options for this test (both are same here)

    -   Use ANOVA table: sums of squares – F-test

    -   Use "Wald" test for parameter: $t = \frac{\beta_1}{SE(\beta_1)}$

    -   Here $t^2 = F$

-   p \< 0.001 $\rightarrow$ reject null ($H_0$) $\rightarrow$ Conclusion: slope is significant

## Model 3: Predicting Weight from Gender

$$
\text{Weight}_p = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Female}_p + e_p
$$ $$
e_p \sim N(0, \sigma^2_e)
$$

-   Note: because gender is a categorical predictor, we must first code it into a number before entering it into model (typically done automatically in software)

    -   Here we code the variable as [Female = 1 for females; Female = 0 for males]{style="color: blue;"}

<!-- -->

-   Estimated parameters:

    -   $\beta_0$: Intercept - predicted value of Weight for a person with [Female = 0 (males)]{style="color: red;"}

    -   $\beta_2$: Slope of Female - Change in predicted value of Weight between Males and Famales

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### R Code

```{r}
#| output-location: default
model3 <- lm(weightLB ~ female, data = dataSexHeightWeight) # model formula
summary(model3)$coefficients |> kable(digit = 3) # regression cofficients table
anova(model3) |> kable(digit = 3) # F-statistic table
```

-   Interpretation

    -   $\beta_0 = 235.9$ pounds is the predicted value of a Weight for a male
    -   $\beta_0 +\beta_1 = 235.9 - 105.0 = 130.9$ pounds is the predicted value of a Weight for a female
    -   $\beta_1 = 105$ expected difference between gender, which is significant based on t-test and F-test

## Model 4: Predicting Weight from Height and Gender

$$
\text{Weight}_p = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{HeightC}_p + \beta_2 \text{Female}_p  + e_p
$$ $$
e_p \sim N(0, \sigma^2_e)
$$

```{r}
#| output-location: default
model4 <- lm(weightLB ~ heightC + female, data = dataSexHeightWeight) # model formula
summary(model4)$coefficients |> kable(digit = 3) # regression cofficients table
anova(model4) |> kable(digit = 3) # F-statistic table
```

-   Interpretation

    -   $\beta_0 = 224.256 (SE = 1.439)$

        -   The predicted weight is 224.256 pounds for a person with Female = 0 (males) and has Height as Mean Height 67.9 inches

    -   $\beta_1 = 2.708 (SE = 0.155)$

        -   $t = \frac{2.708}{0.155}=17.525; p <.001$

        -   The expected change in weights for every one-unit increase in height holding gender constant

    -   $\beta_2=-81.713 (SE = 2.241)$

        -   The expected difference between the mean of weights for males and the mean for females holding height constant

    -   $\sigma_e^2 = 16.283$

        -   The residual variance of weight

## Model 4: By-Gender Regression Lines

Model 4 assumes identical regression slopes for both genders but has different intercepts

-   This assumption of different slopes will be tested statistically by model 5

Predicted Weight for Females with the height as 68.9 inch:

$$
W_p=224.256+2.708\times\color{blue}{(68.9-67.9)} - 81.713*\color{red}{1} \\
= 224.256+2.708-81.712 = 145.252
$$

Predicted Weight for Males with the height as 68.9 inch:

$$
W_p=224.256+2.708\times\color{blue}{(68.9-67.9)} - 81.713*\color{red}{0} \\
= 224.256+2.708 = 226.964
$$

```{r}
#| results: hold
predict(model4, data.frame(heightC = 1, female = TRUE))
predict(model4, data.frame(heightC = 1, female = FALSE))
```

### Visualization: Different intercept and Same slope across groups

```{r}
#| output-location: default

  geom_line() +
  geom_point(aes(y = weightLB, shape = female), size = 2) +
  theme_classic()
```

## Model 5: By-Gender Regression Lines

$$\text{Weight}_p = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{HeightC}_p + \beta_2 \text{Female}_p +\beta_3 \text{HeightCxFemale}_p+ e_p$$

```{r}
#| output-location: default
model5 <- lm(weightLB ~ heightC * female, data = dataSexHeightWeight) # model formula
summary(model5)$coefficients |> kable(digit = 3) # regression cofficients table
anova(model5) |> kable(digit = 3) # F-statistic table
```

-   Interpretation

    -   $\beta_0 = 222.184 (SE = 0.838)$

        -   SE gets smaller compared to Model 4.

        -   The predicted weight is 224.184 pounds for a person with Female = 0 (males) and has Height as Mean Height 67.9 inches

    -   $\beta_1 = 3.189 (SE = 0.111)$

        -   SE gets smaller compared to Model 4.

        -   **Simple main effect of Height:** the expected change in weights for every one-unit increase in height [for males only]{style="color: red"}

    -   $\beta_2=-82.271 (SE = 1.211)$

        -   SE gets smaller compared to Model 4.

        -   **Simple main effect of gender:** The expected difference between the mean of weights for males and the mean for females for people with mean height

    -   $\beta_3 = -1.093 (SE = 1.211)$ , $t = -6.52, p < .001$

        -   **Gender-by-Height Interaction**: Additional change in slope of height for change in gender.

        -   The slope of heights for males is 3.189; the slope of heights decreases 1.093 (2.096) inches/pound for females

    -   $\sigma_e^2 = 5$

        -   Compared to 16.283 in model 4

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Visualization: Different slopes and different intercepts

Model 5 does not assume identical regression slopes

-   Because $\beta_3$ was significantly different from zero, the data supports different slopes for the gender

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| output-location: default
ggplot(dataSexHeightWeight, aes(x = heightC, y = weightLB, color = female)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Model Comparison

-   In practice, the empty model (Model 0) and the full model (Model 5) would be the only models to run

    -   The aim of model comparison is to decide on whether we want more complex model or the simple one

    -   The **trick** is to describe the impact of all and each of the predictors – typically using variance accounted for

-   Residual Variance and $R^2$

## Comparison Across Models

1.  **Are height and gender are good predictors?**
    -   Total explained variances in weight by **height and gender:** Multiple $R^2$ of Model 5
        -   $(3179.09-4.73)/3179.09 = 0.9985$ $\rightarrow$ 99.85% variances in weights can be explained by height and gender
    -   F-test comparing Model 5 to Model 1
        -   $F_{3, 16} = 4250.1$, p \< .001

            ```{r}
            #| code-fold: true
            #| output-location: default
            summary(model5)
            ```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.  **Are Height alone a good predictor?**
    -   Explained **remaining variances** in weight by **height:** Multiple $R^2$ of Model 5 to Model 3

        -   $(293.21-4.73)/293.21 = 0.9839$ $\rightarrow$ 98.39% variances in weights [remaining after gender]{style="color: orange"} can be explained by **the main and interaction effects of height**

    -   F-test comparing Model 5 to Model 3

        -   $F_{2, 16} = 548.74$, p \< .001 suggests the effect of hight on weight is significant after controlling the effect of gender

            ```{r}
            #| code-fold: true
            #| results: hide
            #| output-location: default
            anova(model3, model5)
            ((5277.8 - 75.7)/ (18-16))/(75.7 / 16)
            ```

    -   True explained variances out of total variances in weight: **Unique contribution** of adding Height into the model

        -   Check model 3, we can found that gender explained 90.78% variance of weight

        -   $0.9839 * (1 - 0.9078) = 0.0907$ $\rightarrow$ 9.07% more variances of weights can be explained by height after gender is already in the model

        -   90.78% + 9.07% = 99.85% is the total variance explained by height and gender

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.  **Are gender alone a good predictor?**

-   Explained **remaining variances** in weight by **gender:** Multiple $R^2$ of Model 5 to Model 2a

    -   $(1217.97-4.73)/1217.97 = 0.9961$ $\rightarrow$ 99.61% variances in weights [remaining after height]{style="color: orange"} can be explained by **the main and interaction effects of gender**

-   F-test comparing Model 5 to Model 2a

    -   $F_{2, 16} = 2308.8$, p \< .001 suggests the effect of gender on weight is significant after controlling the effect of height

        ```{r}
        #| code-fold: true
        #| results: hide
        #| output-location: default
        anova(model2a, model5)
        ((21923.5 - 75.7)/ (18-16))/(75.7 / 16)
        ```

-   True explained variances out of total variances in weight: **Unique contribution** of adding Height into the model

    -   Check model 3, we can found that gender explained 90.78% variance of weight

    -   $0.9839 * (1 - 0.9078) = 0.0907$ $\rightarrow$ 9.07% more variances of weights can be explained by height after gender is already in the model

    -   90.78% + 9.07% = 99.85% is the total variance explained by height and gender

## Summary of Unit 2

1.  We learned GLM using the 2-factor model
2.  For specific effect, we examine the t-test of coefficient
3.  For the total contribution of a bunch of effects (main + interaction), we look at R-square and F-test
4.  We sometime need to report predicted regression lines, which can be done in R with ggplot2

# Unit 3: Let's Look at R code together
