## Course Objectives, Materials, and Pre-Requisites:

The online syllabus will always contain the most up-to-date information. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to R programming with an emphasis on data analysis and visualization in environmental and natural resource management contexts. Students will learn through hands-on coding exercises, practical examples, and real-world applications.

This course has three main objectives:

1.  **Develop proficiency in R programming fundamentals**
    -   Master R syntax, data structures, and basic operations
    -   Learn to write efficient, reproducible code
    -   Understand R's package ecosystem and workspace management
2.  **Build practical data analysis skills**
    -   Import, clean, and manipulate various data formats
    -   Create publication-quality visualizations using ggplot2
    -   Perform basic statistical analyses in R
    -   Apply R to environmental and natural resource datasets
3.  **Establish foundation for advanced R applications**
    -   Develop problem-solving strategies for programming challenges
    -   Learn best practices for documentation and version control
    -   Prepare for advanced R applications in environmental science

Class time will be devoted to interactive lectures, live coding demonstrations, and hands-on exercises. All lecture materials, including R scripts and datasets, will be available in .html and .R formats on the course website prior to each class. Weekly coding assignments will reinforce concepts covered in lectures. While recorded lectures will be available upon request, active participation in class is essential for developing programming skills.

-   Required software:
    -   R (latest stable version)
    -   RStudio
    -   Git (for version control)

No prior programming experience is required, but basic statistical knowledge and familiarity with data analysis concepts is recommended. Students should have access to a laptop computer capable of running R and RStudio.

## How to Be Successful in This Class

-   Come to class ready to learn and come with your laptop;
-   Complete in-class exercises;
-   If you become confused or don't fully grasp a concept, ask for help from your instructor
-   Know what is going on: keep up with email, course announcements, and the course schedule.
-   Try to apply the information to your area of interest --- if you have a cool research idea, come talk to me!

# Academic Policies

## AI Statement

Specific permissions will be provided to students regarding the use of generative artificial intelligence tools on certain graded activities in this course. In these instances, I will communicate explicit permission as well as expectations and any pertinent limitations for use and attribution. Without this permission, the use of generative artificial intelligence tools in any capacity while completing academic work submitted for credit, independently or collaboratively, will be considered academic dishonesty and reported to the Office of Academic Initiatives and Integrity.

## Academic Integrity

As a core part of its mission, the University of Arkansas provides students with the opportunity to further their educational goals through programs of study and research in an environment that promotes freedom of inquiry and academic responsibility. Accomplishing this mission is only possible when intellectual honesty and individual integrity prevail.

Each University of Arkansas student is required to be familiar with and abide by the University's **Academic Integrity Policy** at [honesty.uark.edu/policy](https://honesty.uark.edu/policy). Students with questions about how these policies apply to a particular course or assignment should immediately contact their instructor.

## Emergency Preparedness

The University of Arkansas is committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for study and work. In that regard, the university has developed a campus safety plan and an emergency preparedness plan to respond to a variety of emergency situations. The emergency preparedness plan can be found at [emergency.uark.edu](https://emergency.uark.edu). Additionally, the university uses a campus-wide emergency notification system, UARKAlert, to communicate important emergency information via email and text messaging. To learn more and to sign up: <http://safety.uark.edu/emergency-preparedness/emergency-notification-system/>

## Inclement Weather

If you have any questions about whether or not class will be canceled due to inclement weather, please contact me. If I cancel class, I will notify you via email and/or Blackboard. In general, students need to know how and when they will be notified in the event that class is cancelled for weather-related reasons. Please see [here](http://safety.uark.edu/inclement-weather/) for more information.

## Access and Accommodations

Your experience in this class is important to me. University of Arkansas [Academic Policy Series 1520.10](https://provost.uark.edu/policies/152010.php) requires that students with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodations to ensure their equal access to course content. If you have already established accommodations with the Center for Educational Access (CEA), please request your accommodations letter early in the semester and contact me privately, so that we have adequate time to arrange your approved academic accommodations.

If you have **not** yet established services through CEA, but have a documented disability and require accommodations *(conditions include but not limited to: mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical, health or temporary impacts)*, contact CEA directly to set up an Access Plan. CEA facilitates the interactive process that establishes reasonable accommodations. For more information on CEA registration procedures contact 479–575–3104, [ada\@uark.edu](mailto:ada@uark.edu) or visit [cea.uark.edu.](https://cea.uark.edu/)

## Academic Support

A complete list and brief description of academic support programs can be found on the University's Academic Support site, along with links to the specific services, hours, and locations. Faculty are encouraged to be familiar with these programs and to assist students with finding an using the support services that will help them be successful. Please see [here](http://www.uark.edu/academics/academic-support.php) for more information.

## Religious Holidays

The university does not observe religious holidays; however Campus Council has passed the following resolution concerning individual observance of religious holidays and class attendance:

> When members of any religion seek to be excused from class for religious reasons, they are expected to provide their instructors with a schedule of religious holidays that they intend to observe, in writing, before the completion of the first week of classes.
