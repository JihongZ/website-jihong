## What is Quarto

-   An open-source scientific and technical publishing system

    -   Author using Jupyter notebooks or with plain text markdown in your favorite editor.
    -   Create dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable.
    -   Publish reproducible, production quality articles, presentations, dashboards, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.
    -   Share knowledge and insights organization-wide by publishing to Posit Connect, Confluence, or other publishing systems.
    -   Write using Pandoc markdown, including equations, citations, crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more.

## Hello Quarto

-   **Quarto** is a multi-language, next generation version of R Markdown from Posit, with many new features and capabilities. Like R Markdown, Quarto uses knitr to execute R code, and is therefore able to render most existing Rmd files without modification.
-   The following is a Quarto document with the extension `.qmd` (on the left), along with its rendered version as HTML (`.html` on the right).

-   If you prefer to automatically render whenever you save, you can check the [Render on Save]{.underline} option on the editor toolbar. The preview will update whenever you re-render the document. Side-by-side preview works for both HTML and PDF outputs.
