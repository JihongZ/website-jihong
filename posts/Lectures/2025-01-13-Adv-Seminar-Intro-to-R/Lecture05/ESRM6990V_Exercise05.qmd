## Objective

Use the `nycflights13` dataset to analyze flight delays and apply key `dplyr` functions.

## Instructions

Using the `flights` dataset from the `nycflights13` package:

1.  **Filter flights** that departed from JFK in June.
    -   Hint `origin == "JFK"` and `month == 6`
2.  **Select relevant columns**: `year`, `month`, `day`, `dep_time`, `arr_time`, `carrier`, `flight`, and `dep_delay`.
3.  **Arrange flights** in descending order of departure delay.
4.  **Create a new column** called `delay_category`:
    -   `"On Time"` if `dep_delay <= 0`
    -   `"Slight Delay"` if `dep_delay` is between 1 and 30 minutes
    -   `"Severe Delay"` if `dep_delay` is greater than 30 minutes
5.  **Summarize the average delay** for each airline (`carrier`).

## Questions

1.  What proportion of flights from JFK in June were categorized as "Severe Delay"?
2.  Which airline had the second longest average departure delay?

```{r}
#| echo: false
# Load required packages
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)

# Step 1: Filter flights departing from JFK in June
jfk_june_flights <- flights |> 
  filter(origin == "JFK", month == 6)

# Step 2: Select relevant columns
jfk_june_flights_selected <- jfk_june_flights |> 
  select(year, month, day, dep_time, arr_time, carrier, flight, dep_delay)

# Step 3: Arrange by departure delay (descending order)
jfk_june_flights_sorted <- jfk_june_flights_selected |> 
  arrange(desc(dep_delay))

# Step 4: Create delay categories
jfk_june_flights_categorized <- jfk_june_flights_sorted |> 
  mutate(
    delay_category = case_when(
      dep_delay <= 0 ~ "On Time",
      dep_delay > 0 & dep_delay <= 30 ~ "Slight Delay",
      dep_delay > 30 ~ "Severe Delay",
      is.na(dep_delay) ~ "Dont Know"
    )
  )
mean(jfk_june_flights_categorized$delay_category == "Severe Delay") # 0.201
  
# Step 5: Summarize average delay by carrier
avg_delay_by_carrier <- jfk_june_flights_categorized |> 
  group_by(carrier) |> 
  summarize(avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  arrange(desc(avg_dep_delay))
avg_delay_by_carrier # Q1 Answer: VX carrier: Virgin America.

# Step 6: Visualize the average delay per airline
ggplot(avg_delay_by_carrier, aes(x = fct_reorder(carrier, avg_dep_delay), y = avg_dep_delay)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  geom_label(aes(label = round(avg_dep_delay, 1))) +
  labs(title = "Average Departure Delay by Carrier (JFK, June)",
       x = "Carrier", y = "Avg Departure Delay (min)") +
  coord_flip()
```
