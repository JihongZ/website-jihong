# Terminology

## Number of variables involved

-   Univariate data analysis - distribution of single variable
-   Bivariate data analysis - relationship between two variables
-   Multivariate data analysis - relationship between many variables at once, usually focusing on the relationship between two while conditioning for others

## Types of variables

-   **Numerical variables** can be classified as **continuous** or **discrete** based on whether or not the variable can take on an infinite number of values or only non-negative whole numbers, respectively.
-   If the variable is **categorical**, we can determine if it is **ordinal** based on whether or not the levels have a natural ordering.

# Data

## Data: Lending Club

::::: columns
::: column
-   Thousands of loans made through the Lending Club, which is a platform that allows individuals to lend to other individuals

-   Not all loans are created equal -- ease of getting a loan depends on (apparent) ability to pay back the loan

-   Data includes loans *made*, these are not loan applications
:::

::: column
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lending-club.png")
```
:::
:::::

## Take a peek at data

```{r output.lines=18}
library(openintro)
glimpse(loans_full_schema)
```

## Selected variables

```{r}
loans <- loans_full_schema %>%
  select(loan_amount, interest_rate, term, grade, 
         state, annual_income, homeownership, debt_to_income)
glimpse(loans)
```

## Selected variables

| variable | type | description |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| `loan_amount` | numerical, continuous | Amount of the loan received, in US dollars |
| `interest_rate` | numerical, continuous | Interest rate on the loan, in an annual percentage |
| `term` | numerical, discrete | The length of the loan, which is always set as a whole number of months |
| `grade` | categorical, ordinal | Loan grade, which takes a values A through G and represents the quality of the loan and its likelihood of being repaid |
| `state` | categorical, not ordinal | US state where the borrower resides |
| `annual_income` | numerical, continuous | Borrowerâ€™s annual income, including any second income, in US dollars |
| `homeownership` | categorical, not ordinal | Indicates whether the person owns, owns but has a mortgage, or rents |
| `debt_to_income` | numerical, continuous | Debt-to-income ratio |

# Visualizing numerical data

## Describing shapes of numerical distributions

-   shape:
    -   skewness: right-skewed, left-skewed, symmetric (skew is to the side of the longer tail)
    -   modality: unimodal, bimodal, multimodal, uniform
-   center: mean (`mean`), median (`median`), mode (not always useful)
-   spread: range (`range`), standard deviation (`sd`), inter-quartile range (`IQR`)
-   unusual observations

# Histogram

## Histogram

```{r}
summary(loans$loan_amount)
```

```{r message = TRUE, out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = loan_amount)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

## Histograms and binwidth

::: panel-tabset
## binwidth = 1000

```{r out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = loan_amount)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000)
```

## binwidth = 5000

```{r out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = loan_amount)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000)
```

## binwidth = 20000

```{r out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = loan_amount)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 20000)
```
:::

## Customizing labels of histograms

::: panel-tabset
## Plot

```{r ref.label = "hist-custom", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
```

## Code

```{r hist-custom, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = loan_amount)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000) +
  labs( #<1>
    x = "Loan amount ($)", 
    y = "Frequency", 
    title = "Amounts of Lending Club loans" 
  ) 
```

1.  `labs()` can modify axis, legend, and plot labels
:::

## Fill with a categorical variable

::: panel-tabset
## Plot

```{r ref.label = "hist-fill", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
```

## Code

```{r hist-fill, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = loan_amount, 
                  fill = homeownership)) + #<1>
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000,
                 alpha = 0.5) + #<2>
  labs(
    x = "Loan amount ($)",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Amounts of Lending Club loans"
  )
```

1.  Add `homeownership` to fill with certain category
2.  Add `alpha=` argument to set up transparency for the figure
:::

## Facet with a categorical variable

::: panel-tabset
## Plot

```{r ref.label = "hist-facet", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

  labs(
    x = "Loan amount ($)",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Amounts of Lending Club loans"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~ homeownership, nrow = 3) #<<
```
:::

## Color of bar borders

::: panel-tabset
## Plot

```{r ref.label = "hist-color", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
```

## Code

```{r hist-color, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = loan_amount, fill = homeownership)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000, color = "white") +
  labs(
    x = "Loan amount ($)",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Amounts of Lending Club loans"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~ homeownership, nrow = 3) #<<
```
:::

## Position of Histogram Bars

::: panel-tabset
## Plot

```{r ref.label = "hist-dodge", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
```

## Code

```{r hist-dodge, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = loan_amount, fill = homeownership)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000, position = position_dodge()) +
  labs(
    x = "Loan amount ($)",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Amounts of Lending Club loans"
  )
