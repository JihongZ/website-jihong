## In this week

-   **ANOVA is not limited to one independent variable**
-   **Adding a second IV comes in two forms:**
    -   **Blocking: want to statistically control for some IV**
        -   Controlling for a factor that influences the DV, but is not of primary interest to the researcher
        -   Blocks in education - might include school or class or grade.
        -   There might be differences among schools, but we might not care to investigate if one particular school has a different result than another particular one. Still, we want to take to these differences into account statistically.
-   **2. Factorial design: design with more than one IV**
    -   Two treatment factors that interact. e.g., gender (Male vs. Female) x age (Childhood vs. Youth)

## In this week

-   **We used a one-way ANOVA to compare means of two or more groups**
    -   Ex. Effect of tutoring on student grades
    -   One categorical independent variable (three groups: no tutor, once/week, daily)
    -   One continuous dependent variable (grades)
-   **What if we want to examine another independent variable?**
    -   Ex. Type of school setting: Public, private-secular, and private-religious
    -   That is, we think the effect of tutoring on grades might depend on the school setting, so we want to control for school setting.
-   **We can use ANOVA with more than one IV in this case**
    -   Two or more categorical independent variables (factors)
    -   One continuous dependent variable

## In this week

-   **Offers several advantages over a one-way ANOVA:** **1. Allows for greater generalizability of results** - More realistic (life is complex!)
    -   Allows for investigation of interactions ‚Üí through FACTORIAL ANOVA **1. We can ask whether the effect of one variable depends on the level of** **another variable** - Ex. cancer trials; Does the effect of the treatment method depend on stage of cancer? - Economy: requires fewer participants than two one-way designs for the same level of power. **2. Smaller error terms means we have more power**

## In this week

-   **Adding an IV in ANOVA is more powerful than a one-way ANOVA because** **we are able to account for more of the variance by adding additional factors**
    -   For example, let‚Äôs say we are interested in tutoring type on grades, but we already think that school type also affects performance

![](images/clipboard-3940876064.png)

-   Adding school type as an IV explains more variance, thus reducing the amount of error variance
-   Remember we define error as anything NOT explained by the IVs

## Blocking

-   **Blocking factors** and **nuisance factors** provide the mechanism for explaining and controlling variation among the experimental units from sources that are not of interest and part of the error.
-   **Block designs help maintain internal validity** , by reducing the possibility that the observed effects are due to a **confounding factor.**
    -   Confounding factor = a factor which impacts on both IV and DV
-   While also **maintaining external validity** by allowing the investigator to use less stringent restrictions on the sampling population.
-   **When we have a single blocking factor: utilize a randomized complete block** **design (RCBD).**
    -   cf. completely randomized design (CRD) = cares about the randomly assigned treatment
    -   Randomized completed block design (RCBE) = CRD with the blocking
-   Today, will see extensions when more than a single blocking factor exists
    -   Ex. Latin Squares and their generalizations
-   These designs are efficient in terms of power and reducing the error variation.

## Why Use Blocking - Confounding Variables

-   In designing a study, researchers need to anticipate the factors that could undermine the **validity** of the inferences.
    -   Validity is defined as ‚Äú[the approximate truth of an inference]{.redcolor}‚Äù (Shadish, Cook, & Campbell, 2002). Validity is a property of the inferences, not of the research design.
    -   However, design elements can have a profound impact on the inferences we make.
-   Many threats to validity involve inadequate control over **confounding variables**.
    -   A confounding variable is an ‚Äúextra‚Äù variable that the researcher did not account for.
    -   **Confounding variables:** are any other variable that also has an effect on your dependent variable. They are like extra independent variables that are having a hidden effect on your dependent variables.
        -   They can ruin an experiment and give provide the researcher with misleading results.
-   Confounding variables that are not controlled for can suggest there is correlation when in fact there is not or even introduce bias, leading the researcher to find an F-statistic that is too low or too high.
-   For these reasons, it is important to know what a confounding variables is, and how to avoid getting them into your experiment in the first place.
    -   One approach to dealing with confounding variables is through **blocking**.

## When to use this tool

-   Use ANOVA with Blocking to evaluate the equality of three or more means from dependent/related populations. This test basically performs a one-way ANOVA after accounting for the variability among the 'blocks'. Blocks are groups of similar units or repeated measurements on the same unit. ANOVA with blocking is therefore a multiple-sample application of the paired samples t-test.

-   The test makes the following assumptions:

    -   The data are continuous numeric.
    -   The units are randomly sampled.
    -   No interaction between the 'treatments' and 'blocks'.
    -   The groups are normally distributed.
    -   The groups have equal variances.

## Blocking Factor and Nuisance Factor

::::: columns
::: column
-   **Example: Age and Gender**
    -   In studies involving human subjects, **we often use gender** **and age as the blocking factors.**
    -   We partition our subjects by gender and from there into age groups.
    -   Thus, we have **a block of** **homogeneous subjects** defined by the combination of factors, gender and age.
    -   Within each block, we then randomly assign to treatment(T) or control(C).
-   **Example: Age classes and gender** ‚Üí **The key is that age, gender are not a part of our experimental design.**
    -   As we saw, we often use gender and age classes as the blocking factors.

## Blocking Factor and Nuisance Factor

-   Sometimes, confounding variables are **nuisance factor**[^1]

    -   **Nuisance factor**: A factor that probably has an effect on the outcome, but is not a factor that we are interested in.

    -   E.g., Age, Institution, Sites

-   **Another Example: Institution (size, location, type, etc)**

    -   In medical studies, one blocking factor commonly used is the type of institution.
        -   Hopefully removes institutionally-related factors such as size of the institution, types of populations served, hospitals versus clinics, etc.
        -   We expect that these factors would influence the overall results of the experiment.
        -   We are not manipulating institution ‚Äì this is what makes it a nuisance factor

-   So, nuisance factor (variables that can impact on DV, but not the interest of)

    -   If the nuisance factor is known and controllable, we can use ‚Äú**blocking**.‚Äù and nuisance factors become blocking factors (manipulate the block factors to make treatment samples homogenous)
    -   If the nuisance factor is known, but uncontrollable, we considers **ANCOVA**. (gender, class, school)
    -   If the nuisance factor is unknown and uncontrollable (i.e., lurking variable), we re-do the randomization.

## Types of nuisance factors:

## Example

-   We are interested in the performance of four lecture method on math scores.
-   The following math test scores (higher score = better at math) were obtained for three test forms.

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
| Lecture  | Form 1 | Form 2 | Form 3 |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Method 1 | 45     | 43     | 51     |
| Method 2 | 47     | 46     | 52     |
| Method 3 | 48     | 50     | 55     |
| Method 4 | 42     | 37     | 49     |
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
-   In this scenario:
    -   We are interested in lecture method ‚Üí This is our **IV**
    -   Test form may have an effect, but we are not interested in it. ‚Üí Form is the blocking factor
    -   The outcome is math test score ‚Üí This is the DV
    -   Here, all lecture types are applied to all forms
:::
:::::

-   this is called a **‚Äúcomplete‚Äù block design**. ‚Üí Let‚Äôs look at blocking design variations.

## 1. Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD)

-   The mean comparison among specific blocks ($\mu_{form1}$, $\mu_{form2}$, $\mu_{form3}$, $\mu_{form4}$) is not of interest
    -   In a RCBD, the variation between blocks is partitioned out of the MSE, resulting in a smaller MSE for testing hypotheses about the treatments.

$$
Y_{ij} = \mu + \tau_i + \rho_j + \epsilon_{ij}
$$

where:

1.  $Y_{ij}$: math scores for Method *i* and Form *j*
2.  $\mu$: grand mean
3.  $\tau_i$: Method *i* with *i* = 1, ..., 4
4.  $\rho_j$: From *j* with *j* = 1, 2, 3
5.  $\rho_j$ and $\epsilon_{ij}$ are independent random variables such that $\rho_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_{\rho})$ and $\epsilon_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_{\epsilon})$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1.1 Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD)

-   When we have a single blocking factor (Form): utilize a [randomized complete block design]{.bluecolor} (RCBD)[^2].
-   *b* blocks, each with *a* treatment levels
    -   *a* treatment levels are randomly assigned within each block
-   In this case, we have 3 blocks ([Form 1]{.red}, [Form 2]{.green}, [Form 3]{.purple}) with each having 4 treatment levels.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
-   Numbers in each cell are means
-   Within each block, we have designed a more homogenous set of experimental units on which to test math scores.
-   Variability **between** blocks can be large, since we will remove this source of variability, whereas variability **within** a block should be relatively small. In general, a block is a specific level of the nuisance factor.

## 2. Latin Square Design

-   Allow for **two blocking factors**.
    -   Used to simultaneously control (or eliminate) two sources of nuisance variability.
-   **Latin Square Design** gets its name from the fact that we can write it as a square with Latin letters to correspond to the treatments.
    -   The treatment factor levels are the Latin letters in the Latin square design.
    -   The number of rows and columns correspond to the number of treatment levels.
    -   So, if we have four treatments then we would need to have four rows and four columns in order to create a Latin square.

## 2. Latin Square Design

-   Comparing RCBD, or CRD, Latin square design has two nuisance factors.
-   Each treatment occurs only once in each row and once in each column.
-   We assume that three factors (factor of the interest, two nuisance factors) are not interacting with each other.
    - Row: School; Column: Form
    - Treatment factor: Lecture - A/B/C/D
    - Nuisance factors: School - 1/2/3/4 and Form - 1/2/3/4 
    
|          | Form 1 | Form 2 | Form 3 | Form 4 |
|:--------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| School 1 |   [A]{.red}    |   D    |   C    |   B    |
| School 2 |   B    |   [A]{.red}    |   D    |   C    |
| School 3 |   C    |   B    |   [A]{.red}    |   D    |
| School 4 |   D    |   C    |   B    |   [A]{.red}    |

---


-   Within each cell, we have multiple people.
    -   A=Lecture Type 1, B=Lecture Type 2, C=Lecture Type 3, D=Lecture Type 4

|          | Form 1 | Form 2 | Form 3 | Form 4 |
|:--------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| School 1 |   [A]{.red}    |   D    |   C    |   B    |
| School 2 |   B    |   [A]{.red}    |   D    |   C    |
| School 3 |   C    |   B    |   [A]{.red}    |   D    |
| School 4 |   D    |   C    |   B    |   [A]{.red}    |
: {.hover .stripped}

-   The number of rows and columns has to correspond to the number of treatment levels. So, if we have four treatments then we would need to have four rows and four columns in order to create a Latin square. 

::: callout-tip
- This is just one of many 4√ó4 squares that you could create. In fact, you can make any size square you want, for any number of treatment
- that each treatment occurs only once in each row and once in each column.
:::

## 2. Benefits of Latin Square Design?

-   An assumption that we make when using a Latin square design is that the three factors (treatments, and two nuisance factors) do not interact. If this assumption is violated, the Latin Square design error term will be inflated.    

-   Benefits of Latin Square Design?
    -   The more we can control for, the more error variance we explain, **More powerful test of the IV of interest**

    

## 3. Replicated Latin Square Design

-   **Sometimes, the** ***df*** **for a Latin square are too small, so we want to replicate** **the Latin Square to get more participants.** - In this example, I replicate it 2 times ‚Äì the design is different across the replications. - A=Lecture Type 1, B=Lecture Type 2, C=Lecture Type 3, D=Lecture Type 4 \`\`\`

# More than two blocking factors? ‚Üí 4. Greco-Roman Squares

- **When might this occur?**
    - Maybe we think ‚Äúday of the week has an impact‚Äù...
    ‚ÜíŒ±=Monday, Œ≤=Tuesday, ùúí=Wednesday, ùúÜ=Thursday
- This is a **‚ÄúGreco-Roman squares‚Äù** design.
- **Important Considerations about the blocking designs: With Blocking**
    **Designs, we still randomly assign individuals within each block.**

# Blocking: Example

- Let‚Äôs look at a simple example:
- Research question: **What is the effect of time of day of**
    **tutoring session on midterm grades?**
- The Primary Investigator (PI) of the study wants to control
    for tutor, believing some tutors may be better in the
    subject matter than others. Thus, they design a completely
    randomized block design.
- Each tutor works with students in the morning and
    afternoon.
       - In this example, student select their favorite tutor, but
          are then randomly assigned to either a morning (AM)
          or afternoon (PM) session.
       - 200 total students: 91 in the morning, 109 in the


# Blocking: Example

- IV: Time (ùëé= 2 )
    ‚úì 2 levels: AM and PM
- Nuisance factor: Tutor (ùëè= 4 )
    ‚úì 4 levels: Booby, Julia, Monique, and Ned
- DV: Midterm Score
- Null hypothesis pertaining to the IV of interest:
ùêª 0 : ùúáùê¥ùëÄ = ùúáùëÉùëÄ‚Üí a=

‚ÜíWe can partition the effects into three parts:
Sum of squares due to treatments (IV = Time),
Sum of squares due to the blocking factor, and
Sum of squares due to error.

- A randomized block design was used to test the effect of tutoring time on
    midterm scores. For each tutor, participants were randomly assigned to either
    morning (ùëõ = 91 ) or afternoon (ùëõ= 109 ) tutoring sessions.
- The effect of tutoring time was significant (ùêπ 1 , 195 = 119. 39 ,ùëù<
   . 001 ,ùúÇ^2 ùëáùëñùëöùëí =. 298 ) with a large effect. Using a Tukey‚Äôs test, morning is
    significantly higher than afternoon sessions (ùëù <. 05 ).

# Blocking: Example -> 2 Blocking Factors?

- Researchers are interested in comparing the effectiveness of three health
    promotion programs with nursing students.
- The researcher has the following research question: Which of the three health
    promotion programs are most effective at reducing unhealthy coping behaviors?
       ‚úì Unhealthy coping behavior is measured as a composite score from the
          ‚ÄúPoor Coping Behavior‚Äù survey (PCB). High scores on the PCB indicate
          higher levels of unhealthy coping behaviors. Low scores indicate low levels
          of unhealthy coping behaviors. PCB scores can range from 0 (no unhealthy
          behaviors) to 100 (multiple unhealthy behaviors at high frequency and high
          intensity).
       ‚úì The researcher thinks that the health promotion programs for nursing
          students may have an effect on academic and well-being outcomes.
       ‚úì However, gender and status (traditional vs. non-traditional student)
          differences may influence the effectiveness of health promotion programs.


# Blocking: Example -> 2 Blocking Factors?

- The researcher has a sample of 200 nursing students from the state of Arkansas.
    50 students are assigned to each program: Program A, Program B, and Program
    C. In addition, 50 students are assigned to a control group that receives the
    status quo educational model.
