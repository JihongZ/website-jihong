## Review of Randomized Experiments

-   **Randomized experiments** allow researchers to scientifically measure the impact of an intervention on a particular outcome of interest. (e.g., intervention methods on performance)

-   The key to randomized experimental research design is in the **random assignment** of study subjects:

    -   For example, randomly assign individual people, classrooms, or some other group – into [a) treatment or b) control groups]{.redcolor}.

-   **Randomization** means that care is taken to ensure that no pattern exists between the assignment of subjects into groups and any characteristics of those subjects.

    -   Ex: not all females over 30 into the exercise group, females 18-30 in the diet group, and males into the control group.
    -   Every subject is as likely as any other to be assigned to the treatment (or control) group.

## In this week: block design

-   **ANOVA is not limited to one independent variable**
-   **Adding a Second IV comes in two forms of randomization:**
    -   **Blocking: want to statistically control for some IV**
        -   Controlling for a factor that influences the DV, but is not of primary interest to the researcher
        -   Blocks in education - might include school or class or grade.
        -   There might be differences among schools, but we might not care to investigate if one particular school has a different result than another particular one. Still, we want to take to these differences into account statistically.
-   **2. Factorial design: design with more than one IV**
    -   Two treatment factors that interact. e.g., gender (Male vs. Female) x age (Childhood vs. Youth)

## In this week: why block design

-   **We used a one-way ANOVA to compare means of two or more groups**
    -   Ex. Effect of tutoring on student grades
    -   One categorical independent variable (three groups: no tutor, once/week, daily)
    -   One continuous dependent variable (grades)
-   **What if we want to examine another independent variable?**
    -   Ex. Type of school setting: Public, private-secular, and private-religious
    -   That is, we think the effect of tutoring on grades might depend on the school setting, so we want to control for school setting.
-   **We can use ANOVA with more than one IV in this case**
    -   Two or more categorical independent variables (factors)
    -   One continuous dependent variable

## In this week

-   Offers several advantages over a one-way ANOVA:
    1. [Allows for greater generalizability of results:]{.redcolor}  
      -   More realistic (life is complex!)
      -   Allows for investigation of interactions → through FACTORIAL ANOVA 
    
    2. [We can ask whether the effect of one variable depends on the level of another variable]{.redcolor} 
      -   Ex. cancer trials; Does the effect of the treatment method depend on stage of cancer? 
      -   Economy: requires fewer participants than two one-way designs for the same level of power. 
    
---

-   Offers several advantages over a one-way ANOVA:
    3. [Smaller error terms means we have more power]{.redcolor}
      -   For the one-way ANOVA, We are able to account for more of the variance by adding additional factors
      -   For example, let’s say we are interested in tutoring type on grades, but we already include school type also affects performance

![](images/clipboard-3940876064.png)
:::

::: {.column .callout-note}
## Suggestion
Assume that we include tutoring type as the ID. However, we do not include school type at first:

1.   Adding school type as an IV explains more variance, thus reducing the amount of error variance
2.   Remember we define error as anything NOT explained by the IVs
3.   Even though "school" may be not of research interest, there are still have some statistical benefits.
:::
::::

## Blocking factors or Nuisance factors

-   When add more IVs into the models, experiment researchers found different types of factors:
    -   **Nuisance factors**
    -   **Blocking factors**: A special type of nuisance factors
    -   **Confounding factors**
    -   Other terminology: 
        -   experimental unit: the target being applied treatment to
        -   replicates: experimental unit may be measured multiple times.
-   **Blocking factors** and **nuisance factors** provide the mechanism for explaining and controlling variation among the experimental units from sources that are not of interest and part of the error.
-   **Block designs help maintain internal validity** , by reducing the possibility that the observed effects are due to a **confounding factor.**
    -   Confounding factor = a factor which impacts on both IV and DV
-   While also **maintaining external validity** by allowing the investigator to use less stringent restrictions on the sampling population.

## Block design

-   **When we have a single blocking factor: utilize a randomized complete block design (RCBD).**
    -   cf. completely randomized design (CRD) = cares about the randomly assigned treatment
    -   Randomized completed block design (RCBD) = CRD with the blocking
-   Today, will see extensions when more than a single blocking factor exists
    -   Ex. Latin Squares and their generalizations
-   These designs are efficient in terms of power and reducing the error variation.

## Why Use Blocking: Confounding Variables

-   In designing a study, researchers need to anticipate the factors that could undermine the **validity** of the inferences.
    -   Validity is defined as “[the approximate truth of an inference]{.redcolor}” (Shadish, Cook, & Campbell, 2002). Validity is a property of the inferences, not of the research design.
    -   However, design elements can have a profound impact on the inferences we make.
-   Many threats to validity involve inadequate control over **confounding variables**.
    -   A confounding variable is an “extra” variable that the researcher did not account for.
    -   **Confounding variables:** are any other variable that also has an effect on your dependent variable. They are like extra independent variables that are having a hidden effect on your dependent variables.
        -   They can ruin an experiment and give provide the researcher with misleading results.
-   Confounding variables that are not controlled for can suggest there is correlation when in fact there is not or even introduce bias, leading the researcher to find an F-statistic that is too low or too high.
-   For these reasons, it is important to know what a confounding variables is, and how to avoid getting them into your experiment in the first place.
    -   One approach to dealing with confounding variables is through **blocking**.

## Example of Confounding Variable

-  Consider a study examining the relationship between [class size]{.redcolor} and [student achievement]{.redcolor}. 
    -   If researchers find that smaller class sizes are associated with higher achievement, they might conclude that reducing class size improves learning. However, [teacher quality]{.bluecolor} could be a confounding variable. 
    -   If smaller classes tend to have more experienced or highly qualified teachers, the observed effect on student achievement might be due to teacher quality rather than class size itself.

## Example of Confounding Variable

::: {.callout-note}
## Suggestion
When designing an experiment to study the effect of **class size on student achievement** while addressing the confounding variable of **teacher quality**, researchers should consider the following strategies:  

:::: columns
::: {.column}
1. **Random Assignment**:  
   - Randomly assign students to different class sizes to ensure that teacher quality is evenly distributed across groups. 

2. **Matching or Blocking**:  
   - Match teachers based on experience, qualifications, or effectiveness before assigning them to different class sizes. Alternatively, use **blocking** to ensure that teachers of similar quality are present in both small and large class groups.  

3. **Control for Teacher Quality in Statistical Analysis**:  
   - Measure relevant teacher characteristics (e.g., years of experience, certification level, student evaluation scores) and include them as **covariates** in a regression or ANCOVA model.  
:::

::: {.column}
4. **Within-Teacher Design**:  
   - Have the same teacher instruct both small and large classes (e.g., different sections of the same course). This controls for individual teacher differences and isolates the effect of class size.  

5. **Longitudinal Study Design**:  
   - Track students over multiple years, controlling for previous achievement levels and teacher effects, to better isolate the impact of class size on student learning.  

6. **Replication in Multiple Contexts**:  
   - Conduct the study across different schools and regions to ensure that findings are not driven by unobserved local factors, such as school funding or administrative policies.

## Blocking: When to use this tool

:::: columns
::: {.column}
-   Use ANOVA with Blocking to evaluate the equality of three or more means from dependent/related populations. 

-   This test basically performs a one-way ANOVA after accounting for the variability among the 'blocks'. Blocks are groups of similar units or repeated measurements on the same unit. ANOVA with blocking is therefore a multiple-sample application of the paired samples t-test.
:::

::: {.column}
-   The test makes [the following assumptions]{.redcolor}:
    1.   The data are continuous numeric.
    2.   The units are randomly sampled.
    3.   No interaction between the 'treatments' and 'blocks'.
    4.   The groups are normally distributed.
    5.   The groups have equal variances.
:::    
::::

## Blocking Factor and Nuisance Factor

::::: columns
::: column
-   **Example: Age and Gender**
    -   In studies involving human subjects, **we often use gender** **and age as the blocking factors.**
    -   We partition our subjects by gender and from there into age groups.
    -   Thus, we have **a block of** **homogeneous subjects** defined by the combination of factors, gender and age.
    -   Within each block, we then randomly assign to treatment(T) or control(C).
-   **Example: Age classes and gender** → **The key is that age, gender are not a part of our experimental design.**
    -   As we saw, we often use gender and age classes as the blocking factors.

## Blocking Factor and Nuisance Factor

-   Sometimes, confounding variables are **nuisance factor**[^1]
    -   **Nuisance**: a person, thing, or circumstance causing inconvenience or annoyance.
    -   **Nuisance factor**: A factor that probably has an effect on the outcome, but is not a factor that we are interested in. Without considering nuisance factors will cause inaccuracy of the estimation of effects.
        -   E.g., Age, Institution, Sites

-   **Another Example: Institution (size, location, type, etc)**

    -   In medical design, one blocking factor commonly used is [the type of institution]{.redcolor}.
        -   Hopefully removes the effects of institutionally-related factors on experiment outcomes such as size of the institution, types of populations served, hospitals versus clinics, etc.
        -   We expect that these factors would influence the overall results of the experiment.
        -   We are not manipulating institution – this is what makes it a nuisance factor

[^1]: [PennStat STAT503](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat503/lesson/4/4.1)

## Types of nuisance factors:

-   So, nuisance factor:

    1.   If the nuisance factor is known and controllable, we can use “**blocking**.” and nuisance factors become blocking factors (manipulate the block factors to make treatment samples homogenous)
    2.   If the nuisance factor is known, but uncontrollable, we considers **ANCOVA**. (gender, class, school)
    3.   If the nuisance factor is unknown and uncontrollable (i.e., lurking variable), we re-do the **randomization**.

![](images/clipboard-2431159556.png)

## Example of randomized complete block design (RCBD)

-   [Aim]{.redcolor}: We are interested in the performance of four lecture method on math scores.
-   The following math test scores (higher score = better at math) were obtained for three test forms.

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
| Lecture  | Form 1 | Form 2 | Form 3 |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Method 1 | 45     | 43     | 51     |
| Method 2 | 47     | 46     | 52     |
| Method 3 | 48     | 50     | 55     |
| Method 4 | 42     | 37     | 49     |
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
-   In this scenario:
    -   We are interested in lecture method → This is our **IV**
    -   Test form may have an effect, but we are not interested in it. → Form is the blocking factor
    -   The outcome is math test score → This is the DV
    -   each cell represents the average math mean in a combination of experimental settings
    -   Here, all lecture types are applied to all forms
:::
:::::

-   this design setting is called a **“complete” block design** (CBD). → We will look at blocking design variations.

## 1.1. Complete Block Design (CBD) vs. Randomized CBD (RCBD)
### Complete Block Design (CBD)

In a complete block design (CBD), experimental units are grouped into blocks based on a variable that may influence the response variable. Each block contains all treatment conditions, and the treatments are not randomly assigned within blocks; instead, they follow a systematic allocation.

-   Example Using the Provided Table (CBD Interpretation):
    -   The "Forms" (Form 1, Form 2, and Form 3) represent the blocks.
    -   The "Methods" (Method 1, Method 2, Method 3, and Method 4) represent the different treatments.
    -   Each form receives all four methods, meaning the blocking factor (Forms) is accounted for.

However, without random assignment of methods within each form, the design might introduce bias if external factors (e.g., instructor differences) influence the results.

---

### Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD)

In a randomized complete block design (RCBD), the blocking factor is still used, but the treatment assignments within each block are randomized to reduce systematic bias.

-   Example Using the Provided Table (RCBD Interpretation):
    -   Forms still act as blocks.
    -   **Instead of assigning methods in a predetermined order, the four methods are randomly assigned within each form.**
    -   This ensures that any systematic influence of form characteristics is minimized and does not confound treatment effects.
    
## 1.2 Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD)

-   The mean comparison among specific blocks ($\mu_{form1}$, $\mu_{form2}$, $\mu_{form3}$, $\mu_{form4}$) is not of interest
    -   In a RCBD, the variation between blocks is partitioned out of the MSE, resulting in a smaller MSE for testing hypotheses about the treatments.

$$
Y_{ij} = \mu + \tau_i + \rho_j + \epsilon_{ij}
$$

where:

1.  $Y_{ij}$: math scores for Method *i* and Form *j*
2.  $\mu$: grand mean
3.  $\tau_i$: Method *i* with *i* = 1, ..., 4
4.  $\rho_j$: From *j* with *j* = 1, 2, 3
5.  $\rho_j$ and $\epsilon_{ij}$ are independent random variables such that $\rho_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_{\rho})$ and $\epsilon_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_{\epsilon})$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1.3 Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD)

-   When we have a single blocking factor (Form): utilize a [randomized complete block design]{.bluecolor} (RCBD)[^2].
-   *b* blocks, each with *a* treatment levels (a = 4, b = 3)
    -   *a* treatment levels are randomly assigned within each block
-   In this case, we have 3 blocks ([Form 1]{.red}, [Form 2]{.green}, [Form 3]{.purple}) with each having 4 treatment levels.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
-   Numbers in each cell are means
-   Within each block, we have designed a more homogenous set of experimental units on which to test math scores.
-   Variability **between** blocks can be large, since we will remove this source of variability, whereas variability **within** a block should be relatively small. In general, a block is a specific level of the nuisance factor.

## 2. Latin Square Design

-   Allow for **two blocking factors**.
    -   Used to simultaneously control (or eliminate) two sources of nuisance variability.
-   **Latin Square Design** gets its name from the fact that we can write it as a square with Latin letters to correspond to the treatments.
    -   The treatment factor levels are the Latin letters in the Latin square design.
    -   The number of rows and columns correspond to the number of treatment levels.
    -   So, if we have four treatments then we would need to have four rows and four columns in order to create a Latin square.

## 2.1 Latin Square Design

-   Comparing RCBD, or CRD, Latin square design has two nuisance factors: form and school.
-   Each treatment occurs only once in each row and once in each column.
-   We assume that three factors (factor of the interest, two nuisance factors) are not interacting with each other.
    -   Row: School; Column: Form
    -   Treatment factor: Lecture - A/B/C/D
    -   Nuisance factors: School - 1/2/3/4 and Form - 1/2/3/4

|          |  Form 1   |  Form 2   |  Form 3   |  Form 4   |
|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| School 1 | [A]{.red} |     D     |     C     |     B     |
| School 2 |     B     | [A]{.red} |     D     |     C     |
| School 3 |     C     |     B     | [A]{.red} |     D     |
| School 4 |     D     |     C     |     B     | [A]{.red} |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Within each cell, we have multiple people.
    -   A=Lecture Type 1, B=Lecture Type 2, C=Lecture Type 3, D=Lecture Type 4

|          |  Form 1   |  Form 2   |  Form 3   |  Form 4   |
|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| School 1 | [A]{.red} |     D     |     C     |     B     |
| School 2 |     B     | [A]{.red} |     D     |     C     |
| School 3 |     C     |     B     | [A]{.red} |     D     |
| School 4 |     D     |     C     |     B     | [A]{.red} |

: {.hover .stripped}

-   The number of rows and columns has to correspond to the number of treatment levels. So, if we have four treatments then we would need to have four rows and four columns in order to create a Latin square.

::: callout-tip
-   This is just one of many 4×4 squares that you could create. In fact, you can make any size square you want, for any number of treatment
-   that each treatment occurs only once in each row and once in each column.
:::

## 2.2 Benefits of Latin Square Design?

-   An assumption that we make when using a Latin square design is that the three factors (treatments, and two nuisance factors) do not interact. If this assumption is violated, the Latin Square design error term will be inflated.

-   Benefits of Latin Square Design?

    -   The more we can control for, the more error variance we explain, **More powerful test of the IV of interest**

::::: columns
::: column
Assuming we use single IV to explain the outcome vs. {IV, Gender, Age} to explain the outcome.

1.  Adding gender as a nuisance factor explains more variance, thus reducing the amount of error variance.
2.  Adding another nuisance factor is going to explain even more variance

## 3. Replicated Latin Square Design

-   **Sometimes, the** ***df*** **for a Latin square are too small, so we want to replicate** **the Latin Square to get more participants.**
    -   In this example, I replicate it 2 times – the design is different across the replications.
    -   A=Lecture Type 1, B=Lecture Type 2, C=Lecture Type 3, D=Lecture Type 4

| Rep. #1      | Form 1 | Form 2 | Form 3 | Form 4 | Rep. #2      | Form 1 | Form 2 | Form 3 | Form 4 |
|--------|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|--------|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|

| **School 2** |   B    |   A    |   D    |   C    | **School 2** |   C    |   D    |   A    |   B    |

: Replicated Latin Square Design

## 4. More than two blocking factors? Greco-Roman Squares

-   **When might this occur?**
    -   Maybe we think “day of the week has an impact”
    -   → α=Monday, β=Tuesday, 𝜒=Wednesday, 𝜆=Thursday
-   This is a **“Greco-Roman squares”** design.
    -   Greco-Roman squares are a type of combinatorial design consisting of two orthogonal Latin squares of the same order, where each cell contains an ordered pair of symbols from two distinct sets.

|             | Form 1                             | Form 2                             | Form 3                             | Form 4                             |
|--------|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| School 1    | A [$\alpha$]{style="color: red"}   | B [$\lambda$]{style="color: blue"} | C [$\beta$]{style="color: purple"} | D [$\chi$]{style="color: orange"}  |

-   Important Considerations about the blocking designs: With Blocking Designs, we still randomly assign individuals within each block.

## Blocking: Example I

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Let’s look at a simple example:
-   Research question: **What is the effect of time of day of** **tutoring session on midterm grades?**
-   The Primary Investigator (PI) of the study wants to control for tutor, believing some tutors may be better in the subject matter than others. Thus, they design a completely randomized block design.
-   Each tutor works with students in the morning and afternoon.
    -   In this example, student select their favorite tutor, but are then randomly assigned to either a morning (AM) or afternoon (PM) session.
    -   200 total students: 91 in the morning, 109 in the afternoon

-   Two nulls = two values of $F_{obs}$, two values of $F_{crit}$, two decisions

-   Thus, we can partition the effects into three parts:

    -   Sum of squares due to [treatments (IV = Time)]{style="color: red"},

    -   Sum of squares due to the [blocking factor]{style="color: purple"},

    -   and Sum of squares due to [error]{style="color: blue"}.

-   We **do not** model an **interaction** with blocked designs. (we will talk about it later.)

-   ANOVA table:

![](images/clipboard-505786804.png)

## Blocking: Example V

$$
SS_{Total}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{ij}-\bar{y}_{..})^2
$$

-   This is the same as before: take each individual score ($y_{ij}$), subtract the grand mean ($\bar{y}$), and square it $(y_{ij}-\bar{y}_{..})^2$

-   Do this for everyone and then sum over all people $\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{ij}-\bar{y}_{..})^2$

-   However, when calculating IV: $SS_{Model}$, $SS_{Block}$, $SS_{error}$, we need to compute "**marginal means**"

    -   A **marginal mean** is the mean for one level of the variable, ignoring the other variable

## Blocking: Example VI

-   A **marginal mean** is the mean for one level of the variable, ignoring the other variable

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
For example:

-   The AM marginal mean is the average of all students’ midterm scores in the morning, ignoring who they have as a tutor $$
    \bar{y}_{AM.} = 22.95
    $$
-   The Bobby marginal mean is the average of all students’ midterm scores who had Bobby as a tutor, ignoring time of day $$
    \bar{y}_{.Bobby} = 11.91
    $$

## Blocking: Example VII

$$
SS_{Total} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{ij}-\bar{y}_{..})^2=15060.48
$$

$$
SS_{Model(time)} = \sum_{a=1}^{a}n_a(\bar{y}_{a.}-\bar{y}_{..})^2=4489.02
$$

-   where $n_a$ is the group size for AM/PM and $\bar{y}_{a.}$ are the marginal means for AM and PM {22.95, 13.43}

-   This is similar to how we computed $𝑆𝑆_{𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙}$ before: marginal group mean subtract off the grand mean and square it. Sum over all groups.

$$
SS_{Block} = \sum_{b=1}^{b}n_{b}(\bar{y}_{.b}-\bar{y}_{..})^2=3239.43
$$

-   Technically, the blocking factor is just another IV (but we are not interested in or is not within the scope of research question).

    -   $𝑆𝑆_{𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟} = 𝑆𝑆_{𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙}− 𝑆𝑆_{𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙} +𝑆𝑆_{𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘}$ = 7332. 03

## Blocking: Example VIII

-   Then, we can fill out the ANOVA table:

![](images/clipboard-122981133.png)

::: callout-note
Under $\alpha=.05$, for "Model" factor – Time, we have $df_{Model}$ = 1, $df_{error} = 195$: $F_{crit}=3.89$ so sig.

Similarly, for "Blocking" - Tutor, we have $df_{block}$ = 3, $df_{error} = 195$: $F_{crit}=2.65$ so sig.
:::

## Blocking: Example—Write it up!

-   A randomized block design was used to test the effect of tutoring time on midterm scores. For each tutor, participants were randomly assigned to either morning (𝑛 = 91 ) or afternoon (𝑛= 109 ) tutoring sessions.
-   The effect of tutoring time was significant $(𝐹(1,195) = 119. 39, 𝑝<. 001 ,\eta^2_{𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒} =. 298$) with a large effect. Using a Tukey’s test, morning is significantly higher than afternoon sessions (𝑝 \<. 05 ).
-   The effect of the blocking factor, tutor, was significant ($𝐹(3 , 195) = 28. 72 ,𝑝< . 001 ,\eta^2_{𝑇𝑢𝑡𝑜𝑟} =. 215$) with a large effect. Using a Tukey’s test, Monique’s students were significantly higher than other students, and Bobby’s students were significantly lower than other students in the midterm scores (𝑝\<. 05 ).

## Exercises

:::: discussion
-   A poultry experiment was run to investigate the effect of **diet** and **antibiotics** on egg production. They evaluated 2 diets of interest and 2 specific antibiotics that are on the market. The feed and antibiotic were combined and used to fill the feeding trays in barns. They chose 3 poultry farms at random and randomly assigned the combinations of diet and antibiotic to 4 barns within each farm. Total egg production by the chickens was recorded after 4 weeks.
    1.  What is the experimental design (hint: think about the randomization process)?
    2.  Identify which factors are treatment and block.

::: {.callout-note .mohu}
## Answer

a.  RCBD.
b.  treatment: combination of Diet and Antibiotic; block: Farms.
:::
::::

## Summary

- We learn:
  1. Block design is a solution when we have confounding effect
  2. Nuisance factors and treatment factors are very likely to exist in our experiments
  3. We can use RCBD in which treatments are randomly assigned in each block
  4. When we have multiple block factors, we can use LSD or Replicated LSD

## Example: 2 Blocking Factors?

-   Researchers are interested in comparing the effectiveness of three health promotion programs with nursing students.
-   The researcher has the following research question: [Which of the three health promotion programs are most effective at reducing unhealthy coping behaviors?]{.underline}
    -   Unhealthy coping behavior is measured as a composite score from the “Poor Coping Behavior” survey (PCB). High scores on the PCB indicate higher levels of unhealthy coping behaviors. Low scores indicate low levels of unhealthy coping behaviors. PCB scores can range from 0 (no unhealthy behaviors) to 100 (multiple unhealthy behaviors at high frequency and high intensity).
    -   The researcher thinks that the health promotion programs for nursing students may have an effect on academic and well-being outcomes.
    -   However, gender and status (traditional vs. non-traditional student) differences may influence the effectiveness of health promotion programs.

## Example: 2 Blocking Factors?

-   The researcher has a sample of 200 nursing students from the state of Arkansas. 50 students are assigned to each program: Program A, Program B, and Program C. In addition, 50 students are assigned to a control group that receives the status quo educational model.
    -   What is the dependent variable? → PCB SCORES
    -   What is the independent variable of interest? → HEALTH PROGRAM (4 LEVELS)
    -   What is (are) the blocking variable(s), aka the confounding variables, that the researcher might statistically control for? → GENDER, STATUS
