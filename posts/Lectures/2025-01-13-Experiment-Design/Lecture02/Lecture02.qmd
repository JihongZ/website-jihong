## Types of Statistics

### 1. Descriptive Statistics

-   **Definition**: Describes and summarizes the collected data using numbers/values
    -   Central tendency: mean, median, mode
    -   Variability: range, interquartile range (IQR), variance, standard deviation
    -   Shape of distribution: skewness, kurtosis
-   **Examples** of skewness with two graphs:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Inferential Statistics

-   **Definition**: Uses probability theory to infer/estimate population characteristics from a sample using hypothesis testing
-   Visual representation shows:
    -   Population → Sampling → Sample
    -   Sample → Inference → Population
        -   Sample is analyzed using descriptive statistics
        -   Inferential statistics used to make conclusions about population

### 3. Predictive Statistics

-   **Definition**: Use observed data to produce the most accurate prediction possible for new data. Here, the primary goal is that the predicted values have the highest possible fidelity to the true value of the new data.

-   **Example**: A simple example would be for a book buyer to predict how many copies of a particular book should be shipped to their store for the next month.

## Which type statistics to use

1.  How many structures burned in California wildfire in the first week?

    -   [Descriptive]{.heimu}

2.  Which factor is most important causing the fires?

    -   [Inference]{.heimu}

3.  How likely the California wildfire will not happen again in next 5 years?

    -   [Predictive]{.heimu}

4.  How likely human will live on Mars?

    -   [Not statistics. Sci-Fi]{.heimu}

5.  ChatGPT?

## Statistical Hypothesis Testing Steps

**To perform inference statistics, we need to go through following steps:**

1.  State null hypothesis (H₀) and alternative hypothesis ($H_A$)
2.  Set alpha α (type I error rate) to determine significance levels
    -   rejection region vs. p-value
3.  Compute test statistics (i.e., F-statistics)
4.  Conduct hypothesis testing:
    -   Compare test statistics: critical value vs. observed value
    -   Compare alpha and p-value

## ANOVA Introduction

-   ANOVA is one of the most frequently used statistical tool for inference statistics in experimental design.
-   Settings for Analysis of Variance (ANOVA):
    -   One dependent variable (DV),
    -   One independent variable (IV) with multiple levels
-   **Example question**: "Are there mean differences in SAT math scores for high school program type (college prep, vocational, general)?"
-   Course covers advanced ANOVA topics:
    -   Model comparisons
    -   Between/within-subject design
    -   Interaction effects

# Example 1: Political Study on Tax Reform Attitudes

## Background

-   Political scientist study on tax reform attitudes:
    -   Groups: Democrats, Republicans, Independents
    -   Data shows attitude scores (higher score = greater concern for tax reform)
    -   Analysis conducted at α = .05
    -   Data includes:
        -   Mean scores: Democrats (4), Republicans (5), Independents (8)
        -   Standard deviations and variances for each group
        -   Grand mean: 5.625

## Analysis Steps

1.  Hypothesis statements:
    -   H₀: X̄democrat = X̄republican = X̄independent
    -   HA: At least two groups are significantly different
2.  Alpha = 0.05
3.  Test statistics:
    -   dfb = 2, dfw = 13
    -   F_critical = 3.81
    -   F_observed = 20.31
4.  Results show rejection of H₀ (F_obs \> F_critical)

# Example 2: English Learners' digital competency

## Background

-   **Digital literacy** is essential for effective participation in today's society, yet "digital divides"—disparities in access to and usage of digital resources—are prevalent.

-   These divides are particularly significant for ethnolinguistic minority students, such as English learners, who face challenges within educational systems biased toward monolingual English norms.

## Research Purpose and Hypothesis

-   **Research Purpose**: The study examines whether there are [noticeable differences in Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-related achievement, self-efficacy, and perceptions]{.underline} between native English speakers and English learners in U.S. schools. It aims to identify how these differences are influenced by linguistic barriers in the context of digital literacy.

-   **Hypotheses:** The research proposes that [English learners will demonstrate lower levels of mastery experience, self-efficacy, and positive perceptions of Information and Communication Technology]{.underline} compared to native English speakers due to systemic linguistic inequalities in educational settings. These disparities arise from both tangible and intangible barriers to accessing digital resources and support.

## Statistical Testing Review - Part 1

-   Important terminology for hypothesis testing:
    -   Working Hypothesis: Direct statement of research idea/question
    -   Null Hypothesis: No difference/effect
    -   Alternative Hypothesis: Significant difference/effect
-   Example using weight loss study:
    -   Research question: "Do people in different diet groups lose different amounts of weight?"
    -   Hypothesis: "People in different diet groups will lose different amounts of weight"

## Type I & II Errors

-   Four possible outcomes in hypothesis testing:
    1.  Correct Decision (Fail to reject H₀ when true)
    2.  Type I Error (Reject H₀ when true)
    3.  Type II Error (Fail to reject H₀ when false)
    4.  Correct Decision (Reject H₀ when false)

## Alpha Levels and Critical Values

-   Alpha determines:
    -   Critical value of test statistics
    -   Rejection region
-   Example with df_b=2, df_w=13:
    -   α=0.05: F_critical=3.81
    -   α=0.01: F_critical=6.70

## Test Statistics Components

-   Diagram shows variance components:
    -   Total Variability (SST)
    -   Variance explained by model (SSB)
    -   Unexpected Variance (SSW)
    -   Various factor variances (SSA, SSB, SSA×B)

## F-Statistics Calculation

-   Details for computing test statistics:
    -   F_obs = SSb/dfb ÷ SSw/dfw
    -   SSb calculation explained (between-groups variability)
    -   SSw calculation explained (within-groups variability)
    -   F_critical determined by alpha, df_b, and df_w

## Hypothesis Testing Conclusion

-   Final steps in hypothesis testing:
    -   Compare F_obs with F_critical
    -   Compare p-value with alpha
    -   Decision rules:
        -   Reject H₀ if F_obs \> F_critical
        -   Reject H₀ if p-value \< α
    -   Confidence level: (1-α)
