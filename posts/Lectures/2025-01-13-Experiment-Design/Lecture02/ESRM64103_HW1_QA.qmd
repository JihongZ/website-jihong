## Open-Ended Homework Questions on P-values, Alpha, and F-statistics

#### Question 1: Theoretical Foundations

**Question:** [Explain the relationship between the alpha level (α) set by researchers and the interpretation of p-values in the context of F-statistics. How does changing the alpha level affect the interpretation of the results of an ANOVA test?]{.underline}

**Answer:** The alpha level set by researchers serves as a **threshold** for statistical significance. When the p-value obtained from an ANOVA test (which generates an F-statistic) is less than the alpha level, the null hypothesis is rejected. This suggests a statistically significant difference between group means. **Changing the alpha level affects the stringency of the hypothesis test**: lowering alpha (e.g., from 0.05 to 0.01) makes the criterion for rejecting the null hypothesis more stringent, thereby reducing the probability of committing a Type I error (false positive) but increasing the probability of a Type II error (false negative). Conversely, increasing alpha makes the test less stringent, increasing the risk of Type I errors but reducing the risk of Type II errors.

#### Question 2: Practical Application

**Question:** [Consider a scenario where an F-statistic from an ANOVA is significant at α = 0.05 but not at α = 0.01. Discuss the potential implications of this finding in a practical research context, especially in terms of reporting and decision-making.]{.underline}

**Answer:** In a scenario where the F-statistic is significant at α = 0.05 but not at α = 0.01, **the result indicates that while there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis at a 5% significance level, the evidence is not strong enough at a 1% level.** Practically, this suggests that while there is a statistically significant difference between the groups, the confidence in this result is not robust against a stricter criterion designed to reduce the likelihood of false positives. **Researchers should report these findings with caution**, emphasizing the sensitivity of the results to the chosen alpha level. This can affect decision-making, particularly in fields where stricter controls on Type I errors are necessary, such as in clinical trials or policy-making, where the consequences of incorrect decisions can be substantial.

#### Question 3: Critical Analysis

**Question:** [Critically analyze why reliance solely on p-values (from F-statistics in ANOVA, for example) might lead to misleading conclusions in social science research. Suggest additional statistical measures that could be reported to provide a more comprehensive view of the data.]{.underline}

**Answer:** Reliance solely on p-values can be misleading because **p-values only provide the probability of observing data as extreme as, or more extreme than, the data observed if the null hypothesis is true**. They do not measure the probability of the null hypothesis itself, nor do they indicate the size or importance of an effect. In social science research, where complex variables and relationships often exist, this can lead to overemphasis on "statistical significance" while neglecting "practical significance." To provide a more comprehensive view, researchers should also report confidence intervals, which give a range of plausible values for the effect size and help in assessing the precision of the estimates. Additionally, reporting effect sizes (like Cohen's d) is crucial as they provide a sense of the magnitude of differences observed, independent of sample size. These measures help in understanding the practical implications of the findings, not just whether they are statistically significant.
