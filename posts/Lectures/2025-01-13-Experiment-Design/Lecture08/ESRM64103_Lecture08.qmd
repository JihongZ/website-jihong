## Experiment 1

-   **Background**: Testing new fertilizers in different types of crops.
-   **Design**: Crops are divided into 3 different types (blocks). These blocks are again divided into 3 fertilizers (F1, F2, and NF) that are used on those crops. The figure of study design can be visualized as follows:

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20201014082316/RCBDexample.PNG)

```{r}
corn <- factor(rep(c("corn", "rice", "wheat"), each = 3)) 
fert <- factor(rep(c("f1", "f2", "nf"), times = 3)) 
corn
fert
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
y <- c(6, 5, 6, 
       4, 4.2, 5, 
       5, 4.4, 5.5) 

# y is the months the crops were healthy 
results <- data.frame(y, corn, fert) 
gt(results)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
fit <- aov(y ~ fert+corn, data = results)				 
summary(fit)
```

-   **Explanation:** The value of *Mean Sq* shows is blocking really necessary for the experiment. Here *Mean Sq for residuals* `0.1078 << 0.7011`, thus blocking is necessary will give precise values for the experiment. Though this method is a little debatable yet useful. The significance value of every experiment is given by the person taking the experiment. Here lets consider significance has 5% i.e 0.05. The Pr(\>F) value is `0.0553>0.05`. Thus the hypothesis is accepted for the crops experiment. Let’s consider one more experiment.

## Experiment 2

-   **Background:** Comparing the performances of students (male and female) blocks in different environments (at home and at college). To represent this experiment in the figure will be as follows:

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20201015122147/RCBDexample2.PNG)

-   Where *AC*: At College, *AH*: At Home

```{r}
stud <- factor(rep(c("male", "female"), each = 2)) 
perf <- factor(rep(c("ah", "ac" ), times = 2)) 
perf
```

```{r}
y <- c(5.5, 5, 
	4, 6.2) 

# y is the hours students 
# studied in specific places 
results <- data.frame(y, stud, perf) 

fit <- aov(y ~ perf+stud, data = results)				 
summary(fit)
```

-   **Explanation**: The value of Mean Sq is `0.7225<<1.8225`,i.e, here blocking wasn’t necessary. And as Pr value is 0.642 \> 0.05 (5% significance) and the hypothesis is accepted - there is no sufficient evidence suggesting females and males have significant differences in performance.
