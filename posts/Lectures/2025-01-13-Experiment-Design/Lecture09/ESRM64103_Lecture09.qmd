## Previous lectures

*   In experimental design, when we are interested in comparing the means of dependent variable among several groups:
    (@)  **z-test**
        i) A group vs. the population
        
        
    (@)  **t-test**
        i) One group vs. another group
        
    ```{r}
    #| code-fold: true
    set.seed(1234)
    GroupA <- rnorm(100, mean =  0, sd = 1)
    GroupB <- rnorm(100, mean = -1,sd = 1)
    res <- t.test(GroupA, GroupB)
    res
    ```
    
    (@)  **One-way ANOVA**
        i) More than two groups
        
        
##  Next lectures I

1. When comparing the means of DV among several groups *with more than two IVs*, we can use :
    i) Blocking Design
       +   Independent variable: the factor of the interest (→ the factor that we expect to have any meaningful impact on the dependent variable)
       +   Extraneous factor → the factors that impacts on DV
       
::: callout-note
1.  If one of [ [extraneous factors]{style="color:tomato"}]{style="color:tomato"} is expected to have any impact on IV as well, then, it is treated as "[confounding]{style="color:purple"}" factor
2.  If one of  [extraneous factors]{style="color:tomato"} is NOT expected to have any impact on IV, then, it is treated as "[nuisance]{style="color:royalblue"}" factor
    i) If the  [nuisance]{style="color:royalblue"} variable is  [known]{style="color:green; font-weight:bold"} and  [controllable]{style="color:green; font-weight:bold"} (e.g., schools, classes, farms), we use blocking and control it by including a “blocking” factor in our experiment.
    ii) If the  [nuisance]{style="color:royalblue"} factor is  [known]{style="color:green; font-weight:bold"} but [uncontrollable]{style="color:red; font-weight:bold"} (e.g., age), sometimes we can use analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to remove the effect of the  [nuisance]{style="color:royalblue"} factor from the analysis.
    iii) If the  [nuisance]{style="color:royalblue"} factors that are  [unknown]{style="color:red; font-weight:bold"} and [uncontrollable]{style="color:red; font-weight:bold"} (sometimes called a “lurking” variable; e.g., teachers' personality/emotions). We use randomization to balance out their impact.
3.  Generally, we assume that the independent variable and the blocking variable(s) are independent to each other; that is, we do not care about the interaction between these two variables.

##  Types of Factorial Design

2.  When we are interested in comparing the means of dependent variable among several groups **with more than two independent variables**:
3. **Factorial Design**
    + Independent or between-subject design
        - Each individual is in only 1 group or receives only 1 treatment
    + Dependent and/or repeated-measure design
        - Each individual is in each of the groups or receives each of the treatments
    + Mixed design (e.g., split-plot design, etc.)
        - For one IV, each individual is in 1 group or receives 1 treatment
        - For the other IV, each individual is in each of the groups or receives each of the treatments

::: callout-tip
## Examples of multiple-way ANOVA
+ For 2 IVs, each person only 1 group = two-way independent ANOVA
+ For 3 IVs, each person receives each treatment = three-way repeated measures ANOVA
+ For 2 IVs, each person receives 1 treatment for 1 IV and each treatment for other IV = two-way mixed ANOVA

Note. “A (number of IVs)=way (type of design) ANOVA” → Number of IVs- the name changes with each additional factor:
:::        

## Difference of Factorial Design

| Design Type	| Key Feature	| Example	| Statistical Analysis |
|---|-----|-----|-----|
|Split-Plot|	Hierarchical treatment assignment (whole plots and subplots) |	Agriculture: Irrigation (whole plot) & Fertilizer (subplot)	| Mixed-effects model |
|Independent	| Each participant/unit is exposed to one condition only	| Teaching Method 1 vs. Method 2	| Independent t-test, ANOVA |
|Dependent	| Same participant/unit exposed to all conditions	|	Measuring reaction time with different caffeine levels  | Repeated-measures ANOVA, mixed-effects model |

## Example of Factorial Design

+   Research Question: Is there an interaction between school type and tutoring program on academic achievement?
    - For this RQ, we might think that the effect of tutoring program depends on the type of school the
students attend.
    - As shown below, there are three levels for the tutoring program (e.g., no tutor, once a week, and
daily) and three levels for the school type (e.g., public, private-secular, and private-religious).
    - Then, we examine ALL combinations of the levels of these two IVs.
    
::: columns    
::: column
| School\\Program | No Tutor | Once Per Week | Daily|
|---|---|---|---|
| Public | Y11 | Y12 | Y13 |    
| Private-secular | Y21 | Y22 | Y23 |    
| Private-religious | Y31 | Y32 | Y33 |    
:::
::: column
+ This would be a 3 x 3 design: two factors, one with 3 levels and one with 3 levels
    - 3 levels of tutoring program
    - 3 levels of school type
+ Complete term: 3 x 3 two-way ANOVA or 3 x 3 independent factorial ANOVA

##  Next lectures IV: Exercise

::: callout-caution
## Example of Factorial Design
*Question*: **What kind of design is used in the following research question:**

+ Does the effect of three different [drug treatments]{style="color:red; font-weight:bold"} (separate groups for Drug A, Drug B, Placebo) on the level of self-reported [positive mood]{style="color:green;font-weight:bold"} depend on whether the participant received [psychotherapy]{style="color:purple; font-weight:bold"} (treatment group) treatment or not (control group)?
    A.    One-way repeated-measure ANOVA
    B.    2 x 3 split-plot factorial ANOVA
    C.    2 x 3 independent factorial ANOVA
    D.    2 x 3 repeated-measure factorial ANOVA
    
+ Answer: [C]{.mohu}
    - [We have two IVs; drug treatment and therapy.]{.mohu}
    - [One factor, the therapy, has two levels; treatment (therapy=yes), control (therapy=no)]{.mohu}
    - [The other factor, the drug treatment, has three levels; Drug A, Drug B, and Placebo]{.mohu}
    - [And this design does not have the dependent (or repeated-measure) components.]{.mohu}
    - [Generally, the smaller number of levels comes the first.]{.mohu}
    - [So, this is an example of 2 x 3 independent factorial ANOVA.]{.mohu}

## Example of Factorial Design
*Question*: **What kind of design is used in the following research question:**]

+ Is there a difference in the [number of hours]{style="color:purple; font-weight:bold"} studied depending on what university was attended (UA, UAFS, UALR) and whether it was Fall, Spring, or Summer semester across academic cohorts (2012 – 2015)? A different sample of students was taken each semester?
    A.  3 x 3 x 4 independent factorial ANOVA
    B.  3 x 3 x 4 split-plot factorial ANOVA
    C.  3 x 4 independent factorial ANOVA
    D.  3 x 4 repeated-measure factorial ANOVA
    
+ Answer: [A]{.mohu}
    - [We have three IVs; school, semester, and cohort; school has three levels (UA, UAFS, UALR), semester has three levels (Fall, Spring, Summer), and cohort has four levels (2012, 2013, 2014, 2015).]{.mohu}
    - [And this design does not have the dependent (or repeated-measure) components, because “the different sample of students was taken from each semester.”]{.mohu}
    - [Generally, the smaller number of levels comes the first.]{.mohu}
    - [So, this is an example of 3 x 3 x 4 independent factorial ANOVA.]{.mohu}

## Advantages of Factorial Design I

+ Factorial design offers several advantages over a one-way ANOVA:
    1. It allows for greater generalizability of results
        -   More realistic (**external validity**)
        -   Example: One study of using participants with the age groups including Youth and Childhood vs. One study using only Youth
    2. It allows for investigation of interactions (**answer more complicated RQs**)
        -   We can ask whether the effect of one variable depends on the level of another variable
        -   Example: cancer trials; *Does the effect of treatment method depends on stage of cancer?*
    3. It requires fewer participants than two 1-way treatment designs for the same level of statistical power.  
        -   Smaller error terms means more statistical power!
        
## Advantages of Factorial Design II

::: callout-important
+ For example, let’s say we are interested in testing the effect of level of arousal (e.g., anxiety) on math performance, but we already think that gender is associated with performance.
    -   Adding gender as an IV explains more variance, thus, reducing the amount of error variance of DV.
    -   **Note.** We define error as anything NOT related to (explained by) the IVs.

## Steps for conducting two-way ANOVA

-   **Similar to one-way ANOVA**:
    1.  Set the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis → Research question?
    2.  Find the critical value of test statistics (i.e., F-critical) based on alpha and df
    3.  Calculate the observed value of test statistics (i.e., F-observed) based on the information about the collected data (i.e., the sample)
    4.  Make the statistical conclusion → either reject or retain the null hypothesis
    5.  State the research conclusion regarding the research question
    
## Hypothesis testing for two-way ANOVA (I)

+ For two-way ANOVA, there are three distinct hypothesis tests :
    - Main effect of Factor A
    - Main effect of Factor B
    - Interaction of A and B
    
::: callout-note    
Three separate F-tests are conducted for each!
:::

Main effect
: > Occurs when there is a difference between levels for one factor

Interaction
: > Occurs when the effect of one factor on the DV depends on the particular level of the other factor
: > Said another way, when the difference in one factor is moderated by the other
: > Said a third way, if the difference between levels of one factor is different, depending on the other factor


## Hypothesis testing for two-way ANOVA (II)


::: callout-important
## Example
**Background**: A researcher is investigating how study method (Factor A: Lecture vs. Interactive) and test format (Factor B: Multiple-Choice vs. Open-Ended) affect student performance (dependent variable: test scores). The study involves randomly assigning students to one of the two study methods and then assessing their performance on one of the two test formats.

+ **Main Effect of Study Method (Factor A):**
    -   [H0:]{style="color:royalblue; font-weight:bold"} There is no difference in test scores between students who used the Lecture method and those who used the Interactive method.
    -   [H1:]{style="color:tomato; font-weight:bold"} There is a significant difference in test scores between the two study methods.

+ **Main Effect of Test Format (Factor B):**
  -   [H0:]{style="color:royalblue; font-weight:bold"} There is no difference in test scores between students taking a Multiple-Choice test and those taking an Open-Ended test.
  -   [H1:]{style="color:tomato; font-weight:bold"} There is a significant difference in test scores between the two test formats.

+ **Interaction Effect (Study Method × Test Format):**
  -   [H0:]{style="color:royalblue; font-weight:bold"} The effect of study method on test scores is the same regardless of test format.
  -   [H1:]{style="color:tomato; font-weight:bold"} The effect of study method on test scores depends on the test format (i.e., there is an interaction).
:::

## Hypothesis testing for two-way ANOVA (III)
1. Hypothesis test for the main effect with more than 2 levels
    -  Mean differences among levels of one factor:
        i) Differences are tested for statistical significance
        ii) Each factor is evaluated independently of the other factor(s) in the study
    - Factor A’s Main effect: “Controlling Factor B, are there differences in the DV across Factor A?”
      
      $H_0$: $\mu_{A_1}=\mu_{A_2}=\cdots=\mu_{A_k}$
      
      $H_1$: At least one $\mu_{A_i}$ is different from the control group in Factor A
    - Factor B’s Main effect : “Controlling Factor A, are there differences in the DV across Factor B?”
      
      $H_0$: $\mu_{B_1}=\mu_{B_2}=\cdots=\mu_{B_k}$
      
      $H_1$: At least one $\mu_{B_i}$ is different from the control group in Factor A

::: callout-caution
**Question**: what dose "controlling" mean in “Controlling Factor A, ..."?

**Answer**: ["Controlling" means the decrease of error variances by incorporating the effects of factor A on outcome?]{.mohu}
:::

## Hypothesis testing for two-way ANOVA (IV)

::: callout-note
## Example
- **Question**: What are the null and alternative hypotheses for the main effects in the example?:
- **Research purpose**: to examine the effect of tutoring program (no tutor, once a week, and daily) AND types of school (e.g., public, private-secular, and private-religious) on the students’ grades
    - Factor A’s Main effect: “[Controlling school types, are there differences in the students’ grade across three tutoring programs?]{.mohu}”
      
      $H_0$: $\mu_{\mathrm{no\ tutor}}=\mu_{\mathrm{once\ a\ week}}=\mu_{\mathrm{daily}}$
    - Factor B’s Main effect : “[Controlling tutoring programs, are there differences in the students’ grades across three school types?]{.mohu}”
      
      $H_0$: $\mu_{\mathrm{public}}=\mu_{\mathrm{private-religious}}=\mu_{\mathrm{private-secular}}$
