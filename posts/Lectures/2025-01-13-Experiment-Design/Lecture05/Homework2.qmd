## Homework 2: One-Way ANOVA Analysis

### Objective
This assignment aims to guide students through the complete process of conducting a One-Way ANOVA, ensuring they understand the fundamental assumptions, hypothesis formulation, statistical execution, and interpretation of results.

### Instructions
1. **Dataset Selection**
   - Choose an appropriate dataset containing at least one categorical independent variable (with at least three levels) and one continuous dependent variable (DV).
   - Provide a brief description of the dataset, including its source and relevant background information.

2. **Research Question and Hypothesis**
   - Clearly state your research question.
   - Formulate both the null and alternative hypotheses.

3. **Assumption Checking**
   - Evaluate ANOVA assumptions (normality, homogeneity of variance, and independence).
   - Provide diagnostic plots and justify whether the assumptions are met.

4. **ANOVA Execution**
   - Conduct a One-Way ANOVA using R.
   - Report the ANOVA table and interpret the results.

5. **Post-Hoc Analysis and Contrasts**
   - Perform an omnibus test to assess the overall significance.
   - Design and test planned orthogonal contrasts.
   - If necessary, conduct post-hoc pairwise comparisons.

6. **Effect Size Calculation**
   - Compute and report an appropriate effect size (e.g., eta-squared or omega-squared).
   
7. **Results and Interpretation**
   - Summarize key findings in a concise and structured format.
   - Interpret statistical significance, effect size, and practical implications.

8. **R Code Submission**
   - Include well-documented R code for all analyses.

### Submission Requirements
- Submit a **2-3 page document** (excluding references) consisting of:
  - A **1-page report** summarizing the analysis and findings.
  - **1-2 pages of R code** with comments explaining key steps.

### Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria through AI-assisted and peer review:

1. **Coverage (30%)**: Completeness of the analysis, ensuring all required components are addressed.
2. **Structure and Clarity (40%)**: Logical organization, coherence, and readability of the report.
3. **Statistical and Coding Accuracy (30%)**: Correct use of R functions and appropriate interpretation of results.


## Guideline for peer review

Evaluate the student's One-Way ANOVA assignment based on the following criteria. **Provide a score ranging from 0.0 to 10.0 for each criterion**, using the following scale:

  - 1.0 - 3.9 (Not Okay): Significant issues, missing key components, incorrect methodology, or poor presentation.
  - 4.0 - 5.9 (Okay): Some correct elements, but lacks clarity, has errors, or is incomplete.
  - 6.0 - 8.9 (Satisfied): Mostly correct and well-structured, with minor issues or room for improvement.
  - 9.0 - 10.0 (Perfect): Excellent execution with clear, correct, and well-documented work.

    

$$
Score_{Peer1} = Coverage * .3 + Structure * .4 + Coding * .3
$$

$$
Score_{HW2} = \frac{Score_{AI}+Score_{Peer1}+Score_{Peer2}}{3}
$$
