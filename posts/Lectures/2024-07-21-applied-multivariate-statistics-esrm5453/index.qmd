## Schedule of Topics and Events

The online syllabus at the address provided above will always have the most up-to-date information.

## Course Objectives, Materials, and Pre-Requisites:

Multivariate statistical procedures as applied to educational research settings. Emphasis on use of existing computer statistical packages

This course has two main objectives:

1.  **Modern multivariate analysis using observed variables**
2.  **Build a foundation for terminology, concepts, and software from which participants can eventually learn more advanced analysis.**

### Materials

This course offers an exploration of multivariate statistics within the context of education and psychology. Class time will be devoted primarily to lectures and examples. Lecture materials in .html format will be available for download and view at the website above the day prior to class, or else paper copies will be provided in class. Audio/Video recordings of the class lectures in .mp4 format will also be posted online upon requested, but are not intended to take the place of class attendance. Selected book chapters and journal articles will be assigned for each specific topic as needed. The initial list of readings is provided below but will likely be updated throughout the semester. Updates to the reading list will be posted in the online syllabus and announced in class and via email. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) language will be the primary statistical tool used throughout the course, with the [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) front end being the user interface.

## Prerequisite

Participants should be familiar with the general linear model (analysis of variance, linear regression) prior to enrolling in this course (i.e., )

It is assumed that students have has solid statistical training up to and including topics in multivariate statistics (ESRM 6413, 6423, and 6453). In addition, it is assumed you are also familiar with R language. SPSS may not be sufficient for this course.

-   Lectures for theoretical understanding.
-   Hands-on sessions with statistical software.
-   Group discussions and presentations.
-   Research project guidance.

## How to Be Successful in This Class

-   Come to class ready to learn.
-   Complete the out-of-class exercises prior to each class.
-   If you become confused or don't fully grasp a concept, ask for help from your instructor
-   Know what is going on: keep up with email, course announcements, and the course schedule.
-   Try to apply the information to your area of interest --- if you have a cool research idea, come talk to me!

## Software

-   R and R packages (tidyverse)

# Homework Assignments

Student evaluation will be made on the basis of homework grades and quiz grades. Homework (HW) assignments will be posted online. They will be assigned in class and will be due the next week in class. Thus, you will typically have one week to complete the materials. See the course schedule for more details. In-class quiz typically will be administrated in the beginning of each class. Thus, I recommend you all bring your laptop device in class so that you can answer the in-class quizzes.

On the due date, we will review the assignment. If you have questions, feel free to come to my office hours.To make the most of my office hours, please come prepared.

-   In person: This means you should bring printouts and/or your files on a laptop so that we can review them.

-   Electronically: If you have questions about your assignment and cannot make my office hours, you can email me specific and detailed questions. (R code and data set attached to the email)

## Online Homework Portal

1.  [Homework 0 (Demo)](./HWs/HW_demo.qmd)
2.  Homework 1
3.  Homework 2
4.  Homework 3

## Grading

Your grade in this class will be determined based on homework assignment and in class quizzes on the material and required readings. There will be 3 homework assignments. The number of in-class quizzes will be as same as the number of in-person class.

All homework and answers must be your own and not be copied or paraphrased from anyone else's answers. Students will have the opportunity to earn up to **100 total points** in the course. Up to 84 points can be earned from assignments (approximately 28 points for each homework in total). Up to **16 points** may be earned from in-class quizzes on the material and required readings, but students must be present on the day the quiz is administered to earn these points. Please note there will be at least one opportunity to earn up to **5 points of extra credit** (labeled Homework 0 in the online course website).

| Percentage of Points | Grade |
|----------------------|-------|
| 100-90               | A     |
| 89-90                | B     |
| 79-70                | C     |
| 69-60                | D     |
| \< 60                | F     |

## Policy on Late Homework Assignments and Incompletes:

In order to be able to provide the entire class with prompt feedback, late homework assignments will incur a **4-point penalty**. However, extensions may be granted as needed for extenuating circumstances (e.g., conferences, family obligations) if requested at least three weeks in advance of the due date. As noted above, missed in-class quizzes cannot be made up.

# Academic Policies

## AI Statement

Specific permissions will be provided to students regarding the use of generative artificial intelligence tools on certain graded activities in this course. In these instances, I will communicate explicit permission as well as expectations and any pertinent limitations for use and attribution. Without this permission, the use of generative artificial intelligence tools in any capacity while completing academic work submitted for credit, independently or collaboratively, will be considered academic dishonesty and reported to the Office of Academic Initiatives and Integrity.

## Academic Integrity

You are responsible for reading and understanding the University of Arkansas' Academic Integrity Policy. You are expected to complete all assignments and exams with the highest level of integrity. Any form of academic dishonesty will result in a failing grade for the course and will be reported to the Office of Academic Integrity. If you have any questions about what constitutes academic dishonesty, please ask me.

## Emergency Preparedness

The University of Arkansas is committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for study and work. In that regard, the university has developed a campus safety plan and an emergency preparedness plan to respond to a variety of emergency situations. The emergency preparedness plan can be found at emergency.uark.edu. Additionally, the university uses a campus-wide emergency notification system, UARKAlert, to communicate important emergency information via email and text messaging. To learn more and to sign up: http://safety.uark.edu/emergency-preparedness/emergency-notification-system/

## Inclement Weather

Each faculty member is responsible for determining whether or not to cancel class due to inclement weather. If you have any questions about whether or not class will be held, please contact me. If I cancel class, I will notify you via email and/or Blackboard. In general, students need to know how and when they will be notified in the event that class is cancelled for weather-related reasons. Please see [here](http://safety.uark.edu/inclement-weather/) for more information.

## Academic Support

A complete list and brief description of academic support programs can be found on the University's Academic Support site, along with links to the specific services, hours, and locations. Faculty are encouraged to be familiar with these programs and to assist students with finding an using the support services that will help them be successful. Please see [here](http://www.uark.edu/academics/academic-support.php) for more information.

## Religious Holidays

The university does not observe religious holidays; however Campus Council has passed the following resolution concerning individual observance of religious holidays and class attendance:

> When members of any religion seek to be excused from class for religious reasons, they are expected to provide their instructors with a schedule of religious holidays that they intend to observe, in writing, before the completion of the first week of classes.
