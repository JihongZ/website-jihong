## Previous Class

1.  Show how to estimate unidimensional latent variable models with polytomous data
    -   Also know as [Polytomous]{.underline} I[tem response theory]{.underline} (IRT) or [Item factor analysis]{.underline} (IFA)
2.  Distributions appropriate for polytomous (discrete; data with lower/upper limits)

## Today's Lecture Objectives

1.  How to model multidimensional factor structures
2.  Show how to estimate models with missing data

## Example Data: Conspiracy Theories

-   Today's example is from a bootstrap resample of 177 undergraduate students at a large state university in the Midwest.
-   The survey was a measure of 10 questions about their beliefs in various conspiracy theories that were being passed around the internet in the early 2010s
-   All item responses were on a 5-point Likert scale with:
    1.  Strong Disagree
    2.  Disagree
    3.  Neither Agree nor Disagree
    4.  Agree
    5.  Strongly Agree
-   The purpose of this survey was to study individual beliefs regarding conspiracies.
-   Our purpose in using this instrument is to provide a context that we all may find relevant as many of these conspiracies are still prevalent.

# Multidimensionality

## More than one Latent Variable - Latent Parameter Space

We need to create latent variables by specifying which items measure which latent variables in an analysis model

-   This procedure Called different names by different fields:

    -   Alignment (education measurement)

    -   Factor pattern matrix (factor analysis)

    -   Q-matrix (Question matrix; diagnostic models and multidimensional IRT)

## From Q-matrix to Model

The alignment provides a specification of which latent variables are measured by which items

-   Sometimes we say items "load onto" factors

The math definition of either of these terms is simply whether or not a latent variable appears as a predictor for an item

-   For instance, item one appears to measure nongovernment conspiracies, meaning its alignment (row vector of the Q-matrix)

    ```{.r}
             Gov NonGov 
    item1     0      1 
    ```

## From Q-matrix to Model (Cont.)

The model for the first item is then built with only the factors measured by the item as being present:

$$
f(E(Y_{p1}|\boldsymbol{\theta_p})=\mu_1 + \boldsymbol{0}*\lambda_{11}\theta_{p1} +\boldsymbol{1}*\lambda_{21}\theta_{p2} \\=\mu_1 + \lambda_{21}\theta_{p2} 
$$

Where:

-   $\mu_1$ is the item intercept

-   $\lambda_{\bf{1}1}$ is the factor loading for item 1 (the first subscript) loaded on factor 1 (the second subscript)

-   $\theta_{p1}$ is the value of the latent variable for person *p* and factor 1

The second factor is not included in the model for the item

## More Q-matrix

We could generalize the previous function with Q-matrix

$$
Q=\begin{bmatrix}q_{11}\ \ \ 0\\0\ \ \  q_{12}\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
f(E(Y_{p1}|\boldsymbol{\theta_p})
&=\mu_1+q_{11}(\lambda_{11}\theta_{p1})+q_{12}(\lambda_{12}\theta_{p2})\\
&= \mu_1 + \boldsymbol{\theta_p\text{diag}(q)\lambda}
\end{align} 
$$

Where:

-   \$\\lambda_1\$ = $\bb{Q}$ contains all possible factor loadings for item 1 (size 2 $\times$ 1)

-   $\theta_p$

# Missing Data

## Dealing with Missing Data in Stan

If you ever attempted to analyze missing data in `Stan`, you likely received an error message:

`Error: Variable 'Y' has NA values.`

That is because, by default, `Stan` does not model missing data

-   Instead, we have to get `Stan` to work with the data we have (the values that are not missing)

-   That does not mean remove cases where any observed variables are missing

## Example Missing Data

To make things a bit easier, I'm only turning one value into missing data (the first person's response to the first item)

```{r}
#| eval: true
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
library(here)
library(blavaan)
self_color <- c("#DB7093", "#AFEEEE", "#3CB371", "#9370DB", "#FFD700")
root_dir <- "posts/2024-01-12-syllabus-adv-multivariate-esrm-6553/Lecture07/Code"
current_dir <- "posts/2024-01-12-syllabus-adv-multivariate-esrm-6553/Lecture10/Code"
save_dir <- "~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/2024 Spring/ESRM6553 - Advanced Multivariate Modeling/Lecture10"
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
# Import data ===============================================================================
dat <- read.csv(here(root_dir, 'conspiracies.csv'))
conspiracyItems <- dat[,1:10]
colnames(conspiracyItems) <- paste0('item', 1:10)

# make some cases missing for demonstration:
conspiracyItems[1,1] = NA
```

Note that all code will work with as missing as you have

-   Observed variables do have to have some values that are not missing
