However, extensions will be granted as needed for extenuating circumstances (e.g., conferences, comprehensive exams, family obligations) if requested at least two weeks in advance of the due date.\n\n## Homework Delivery Format\n\n:::: columns\n::: column\n1.  [Online google form]{.underline}\n:::\n\n::: column\n![](images/homework_screenshot.png)\n:::\n::::\n\n## Our Other Responsibility\n\n-   My job (besides providing materials and assignments):\n\n    -   **Answer questions** via email, in individual meetings, or in group-based zoom office hours—you can each work on homework during office hours and get immediate assistance (and then keep working)\n\n        -   Email me first\n\n-   Your job (in descending order of timely importance):\n\n    -   **Ask questions**—preferably in class, but any time is better than none\n\n    -   **Frequently review** the class material, focusing on mastering the vocabulary, logic, and procedural skills\n\n    -   Don't wait until the last minute to start homework, and don't be afraid to **ask for help if you get stuck** on one thing for more than 15 minutes\n\n        -   Please email me (jzhang\\@uark.edu) a screenshot of your code+error so I can respond easily\n\n    -   **Practice** using the software to implement the techniques you are learning on **data you care about**\n\n    -   **Do the readings** for a broader perspective and additional example (best after the lecture)\n\n## More About Your Experience in this Class\n\n-   **Attendance**: Strongly recommended but not required\n\n    -   **Please do not attend in-person if you might be sick!**\n\n    -   **Please do not attend** if you received the inclement weather notification\n\n    -   You can also join the class via Zoom\n\n    -   You won't miss out: I will post **YouTube** recordings (audio + screen share) by requested at the course website.\n\n-   **Changes** will be sent via email by 9 am on class days\n\n    -   I will update the homework and in-class quiz links on class days. If not uploaded, then there are two situations: (1) I forget to do that. I will re-upload later and notify you by emails. (2) I decide not to upload it or remove it.\n\n    -   I may change to zoom-only for dangerous weather or if I am sick.\n\n## Statistical Software\n\n-   I will show examples primarily using **R and R packages**. Some important R packages include:\n\n    -   **Tidyverse**: a comprehensive R package including multiple mini packages for multiple data cleaning, data transformation.\n\n    -   **ggplot2**: a popular package for data visualization\n\n-   **Why not SPSS?**\n\n    -   [SPSS could only be used for some—but not all–of our content]{.mohu}\n\n    -   More importantly, it doesn't have as much room to grow; R has many new packages being developed via CRAN and GitHub\n\n-   **Why not SAS?**\n\n    -   SAS is not **open-sourced**, meaning that we cannot check source code if something goes wrong\n\n    -   SAS is also commercial, but R is free\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## What We Will Cover\n\n::: columns\n-   Hypothesis Testing\n-   ANOVA\n    -   One-way\n    -   Two-way\n    -   Repeated-measure\n-   ANCOVA\n-   Linear Mixed Model\n:::\n\n# Unit 2: Brief Introduction to R\n\n## Why R?\n\n-   There are some point to consider\n\n    -   R packages are only as good as their authors (so little quality control)\n\n    -   Syntax and capabilities are idiosyncratic to the packages\n\n-   **The good things** are:\n\n    -   If you really master R, you can do by yourself (write your own algorithm for complex model)\n\n    -   You can check the source code of R packages and know where issues come from\n\n    -   You can communicate with R package authors and provide some suggestions\n\n    -   You can be R package author yourself and be famous\n\n## What is R\n\n:::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   **R** is an comprehensive statistical and graphical programming language\n\n-   We can use **R language** via multiple graphical user inferences or IDE, i.e., terminal, VS Code or RStudio.\n\n    -   We will mainly focus on RStudio because of its convenience\n\n    -   Rstudio is a product of posit company and is free to use for personal use\n:::\n\n:::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n::: panel-tabset\n## Terminal\n\n![][2]\n\n## Rstudio\n\n![][3]\n\n## VSCode\n\n![][4]\n:::\n::::\n::::::\n\n  [2]: figures/terminal.png {fig-align=\"left\" width=\"100%\"}\n  [3]: figures/Rstudio.png {fig-align=\"left\" width=\"100%\"}\n  [4]: figures/VsCode.png {fig-align=\"left\" width=\"100%\"}\n\n## RStudio User Interface\n\n![][5]\n\n  [5]: figures/Rstudio_labelled.png {fig-align=\"left\" width=\"100%\"}\n\n## More RStudio\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIrsOBy5k58 width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" >}}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Installation of R and RStudio\n\n-   You can download and install **R base** via r-project.org (currently R-4.4.1)\n\n    -   for [Linux]\n\n    -   for [Windows]\n\n    -   for [MacOS]\n\n-   Then, after the installation of R, you can download RStudio via posit.co (currently)\n\n    -   for [Windows][6]\n\n    -   for [MacOS][7]\n\n-   After installation of R and RStudio, you can open up the RStudio to start your R programming.\n\n    -   however, your R only has the **base** package\n\n    -   To enhance its utility, most users will install **R packages** for certain purposes\n\n  [Linux]: https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/\n  [Windows]: https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/\n  [MacOS]: https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/\n  [6]: https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/windows/RStudio-2024.04.2-764.exe\n  [7]: https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/macos/RStudio-2024.04.2-764.dmg\n\n## R packages\n\n-   R packages are uploaded to some platforms (i.e., CRAN or Github) by researchers or companies\n\n    -   Those R packages typically have their version numbers. Some functions may be available for some version (like Ver. 1.1) but not be available in other versions.\n\n    -   Do not upgrade your packages if you code is running well\n\n-   R users are free to download and use those R packages\n\n    -   To download certain package, you should know package name\n\n    -   For example, if you want to download the latest version of `tidyverse` package, you can type in following command in **the console panel** of Rstudio\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n    install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n    -   Or if you want to install the older version of package\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n    library(devtools)\n    install_version(\"tidyverse\", version = \"1.3.0\", repos = \"http://cran.us.r-project.org\")\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n    -   If you find some error message like:\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n    \n    ```\n    Error in unknown_function(): could not find function \"unknown_function\"\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n## More about R packages\n\n-   **CRAN** (Comprehensive R Archive Network) is a network of servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R.\n    -   It contains most stable version of packages.\n    -   Most of time, we download package from CRAN\n-   **Github** is for the fast development for R packages\n    -   It contains the up-to-date version of R which may potentially be unstable\n\n    -   You can download the package from Github using `pak` package\n\n\n        ::: {.cell}\n        \n        ```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n        pak::pak(\"tidyverse/ggplot2\")\n        ```\n        :::\n\n\n    -   You can update the package and its dependencies\n\n\n        ::: {.cell}\n        \n        ```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n        pak::pkg_install(\"ggplot2\", upgrade = TRUE)\n        ```\n        :::\n\n\n## R functions\n\n-   To operate certain tasks, you need to use functions contained in R packages\n\n    -   Note: Package is loaded in your session before you can call the function name without specifying the package name\n\n\n        ::: {.cell}\n        \n        ```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n        install.packages(\"remotes\") # if you did not install the remotes package before\n        library(remotes)\n        remotes::install_github(\"JihongZ/ESRM64103\", force = TRUE)\n        ```\n        :::\n\n\n\n  [8]: figures/function.png {width=\"100%\"}\n\n## R functions (Cont.)\n\n-   Question: How do you know whether the package has been loaded or not\n\n-   You can use `sessionInfo` function\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n    sessionInfo()\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n    R version 4.5.1 (2025-06-13)\n    Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu\n    Running under: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS\n    \n    Matrix products: default\n    BLAS:   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libblas.so.3 \n    LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.26.so;

Note that the syllabus, schedule, and all materials are uploaded online the week before class.\n2.  We learn that R, Rstudio, and Quarto (*.qmd*) can be used to execute R code/syntax.\n3.  In-class quiz will be administered randomly. Should be quick and easy. Don't be stressful ever!\n4.  Office hour will be 2PM - 4PM on Monday. Feel free to stop by my office and ask questions.\n5.  Next week, we will start to learn some basics about Experimental Design",
