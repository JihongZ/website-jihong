Set the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis → Research question?\n    2.  Find the critical value of test statistics (i.e., F-critical) based on alpha and df\n    3.  Calculate the observed value of test statistics (i.e., F-observed) based on the information about the collected data (i.e., the sample)\n    4.  Make the statistical conclusion → either reject or retain the null hypothesis\n    5.  State the research conclusion regarding the research question\n\n## Hypothesis testing for two-way ANOVA (I)\n\n-   For two-way ANOVA, there are three distinct hypothesis tests :\n    -   Main effect of Factor A\n    -   Main effect of Factor B\n    -   Interaction of A and B\n\n::: callout-note\n### Definition\n\nF-test\n\n:   Three separate F-tests are conducted for each!\n\nMain effect\n\n:   Occurs when there is a difference between levels for one factor\n\nInteraction\n\n:   Occurs when the effect of one factor on the DV depends on the particular level of the other factor\n\n:   Said another way, when the difference in one factor is moderated by the other\n\n:   Said a third way, if the difference between levels of one factor is different, depending on the other factor\n:::\n\n## Hypothesis testing for two-way ANOVA (II)\n\n::: callout-important\n## Example\n\n**Background**: A researcher is investigating how study method (Factor A: Lecture vs. Interactive) and test format (Factor B: Multiple-Choice vs. Open-Ended) affect student performance (dependent variable: test scores). The study involves randomly assigning students to one of the two study methods and then assessing their performance on one of the two test formats.\n\n-   **Main Effect of Study Method (Factor A):**\n    -   [H0:]{style=\"color:royalblue; font-weight:bold\"} There is no difference in test scores between students who used the Lecture method and those who used the Interactive method.\n    -   [H1:]{style=\"color:tomato; font-weight:bold\"} There is a significant difference in test scores between the two study methods.\n-   **Main Effect of Test Format (Factor B):**\n    -   [H0:]{style=\"color:royalblue; font-weight:bold\"} There is no difference in test scores between students taking a Multiple-Choice test and those taking an Open-Ended test.\n    -   [H1:]{style=\"color:tomato; font-weight:bold\"} There is a significant difference in test scores between the two test formats.\n-   **Interaction Effect (Study Method × Test Format):**\n    -   [H0:]{style=\"color:royalblue; font-weight:bold\"} The effect of study method on test scores is the same regardless of test format.\n    -   [H1:]{style=\"color:tomato; font-weight:bold\"} The effect of study method on test scores depends on the test format (i.e., there is an interaction).\n:::\n\n## Hypothesis testing for two-way ANOVA (III)\n\n1.  Hypothesis test for the main effect with more than 2 levels\n    -   Mean differences among levels of one factor:\n\n        i)  Differences are tested for statistical significance\n        ii) Each factor is evaluated independently of the other factor(s) in the study\n\n    -   Factor A’s Main effect: “Controlling Factor B, are there differences in the DV across Factor A?”\n\n        $H_0$: $\\mu_{A_1}=\\mu_{A_2}=\\cdots=\\mu_{A_k}$\n\n        $H_1$: At least one $\\mu_{A_i}$ is different from the control group in Factor A\n\n    -   Factor B’s Main effect : “Controlling Factor A, are there differences in the DV across Factor B?”\n\n        $H_0$: $\\mu_{B_1}=\\mu_{B_2}=\\cdots=\\mu_{B_k}$\n\n        $H_1$: At least one $\\mu_{B_i}$ is different from the control group in Factor A\n\n::: callout-caution\n**Question**: what dose \"controlling\" mean in “Controlling Factor A, ...\"?\n\n**Answer**: [\"Controlling\" means the decrease of error variances by incorporating the effects of factor A on outcome?]{.mohu}\n:::\n\n## Hypothesis testing for two-way ANOVA (IV)\n\n::: callout-note\n### Example: Tutoring Program and Types of Schools on Grades\n\n-   IVs:\n    1.

Observations are independent. → Independency\n-   **Robustness** of assumption violations:\n    1.  Violations of independence assumption: bad news! → Not robust to this!\n    2.  Having a large N and equal cell sizes protects you against violations of the normality assumption → Rough suggestion: have at least 15 participants per cell → If you don’t have large N or equal groups, check cell normality 2 ways: (1) skew/kurtosis values, (2) histograms\n    3.  Use Levene’s test to check homogeneity of cell variance assumption → If can’t assume equal variances, use Welch or Brown-Forsyth. → However, F is somewhat robust to violations of HOV as long as within-cell standard deviations are approximately equal.\n\n## Two-way ANOVA: R Calculation\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### Background\n\nThis research study is an adaptation of Gueguen (2012) described in Andy Field’s text. Specifically, the researchers hypothesized that **people with tattoos and piercings were more likely to engage in riskier behavior than those without tattoos and piercings**. In addition, the researcher wondered whether this difference varied, depending on whether a person was male or female.\n\nQuestion: How many IVs? How many levels for each.\n\nAnswer: [2 IVs: (1) Whether or not having Tattos and Piercings (2) Male of Female. DV: Frequency of risk behaviors]{.mohu}\n\n### Data screening\n![](images/clipboard-655219567.png)\n\n:::\n\n## Data input in R\n\nEither you can import a CSV file, or manually import the data points (for small samples).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntatto_piercing = rep(c(TRUE, FALSE), each = 8)\ngender = rep(c(\"Male\", \"Female\", \"Male\", \"Female\"), each = 4)\noutcome = c(5.4, 6.7, 1.8, 6.1, 5.9, 4.6, 2.7, 3.8,\n            2.6, 5.8, 1.5, 2.1, .6, .7, .7, 1.8)\n\ndat <- data.frame(\n  tatto_piercing = tatto_piercing,\n  gender = gender,\n  outcome = outcome\n)\ndat\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   tatto_piercing gender outcome\n1            TRUE   Male     5.4\n2            TRUE   Male     6.7\n3            TRUE   Male     1.8\n4            TRUE   Male     6.1\n5            TRUE Female     5.9\n6            TRUE Female     4.6\n7            TRUE Female     2.7\n8            TRUE Female     3.8\n9           FALSE   Male     2.6\n10          FALSE   Male     5.8\n11          FALSE   Male     1.5\n12          FALSE   Male     2.1\n13          FALSE Female     0.6\n14          FALSE Female     0.7\n15          FALSE Female     0.7\n16          FALSE Female     1.8\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n### Your turn\n\nImport the following data set into R manually.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Tutor   | AM| PM|\n|:-------|--:|--:|\n|Bobby   | 19| 16|\n|Julia   | 15| 10|\n|Monique | 14| 18|\n|Ned     | 13| 11|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nHint: \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrep(c(\"A\", \"B\"), 2)\nrep(c(\"A\", \"B\"), each = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"A\" \"B\" \"A\" \"B\"\n[1] \"A\" \"A\" \"B\" \"B\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n### Exercise\n```{webr-r}\n# Manually import the data in R\n\nTutor = rep(______)\nTime = rep(______)\nGrade = c(_______)\n\ndat_ex1 <- data.frame(\n  Tutor = Tutor,\n  Time = Time, \n  Grade = Grade\n)\n```\n### Answer\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nTutor = rep(c(\"Bobby\", \"Julia\", \"Monique\", \"Ned\"), 2)\nTime = rep(c(\"AM\", \"PM\"), each = 4)\nGrade = c(19, 15, 14, 13, 16, 10, 18, 11)\n\ndat_ex11 <- data.frame(\n  Tutor = Tutor,\n  Time = Time, \n  Grade = Grade\n)\ndat_ex11\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n    Tutor Time Grade\n1   Bobby   AM    19\n2   Julia   AM    15\n3 Monique   AM    14\n4     Ned   AM    13\n5   Bobby   PM    16\n6   Julia   PM    10\n7 Monique   PM    18\n8     Ned   PM    11\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n## Step 2: Sum of Squares of main effects\n\n$$\nSS_A = \\sum n_a (M_{Aa} - M_T)^2\n$$\n\n- $M_{Aa}$ marginal mean of main effect A at each level\n- $n_a$: sample size for factor A at each level\n- $M_T$: grand mean of outcome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nM_A_table <-  dat |> \n  group_by(tatto_piercing) |>  \n  summarise(\n    N = n(),\n    Mean = mean(outcome)\n  ) \nM_T = mean(dat$outcome)\nM_A_table\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  tatto_piercing     N  Mean\n  <lgl>          <int> <dbl>\n1 FALSE              8  1.98\n2 TRUE               8  4.62\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nM_A_table$N[1] * (M_A_table$Mean[1] - M_T)^2 + \n  M_A_table$N[2] * (M_A_table$Mean[2] - M_T)^2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 28.09\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nor \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum(M_A_table$N * (M_A_table$Mean - M_T)^2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 28.09\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n### Your turn: Sum of squares of Gender\n\n```{webr-r}\n#| context: setup\ntatto_piercing = rep(c(TRUE, FALSE), each = 8)\ngender = rep(c(\"Male\", \"Female\", \"Male\", \"Female\"), each = 4)\noutcome = c(5.4, 6.7, 1.8, 6.1, 5.9, 4.6, 2.7, 3.8,\n            2.6, 5.8, 1.5, 2.1, .6, .7, .7, 1.8)\n\ndat <- data.frame(\n  tatto_piercing = tatto_piercing,\n  gender = gender,\n  outcome = outcome\n)\ndat\n```\n\n`dat` object has already been loaded into R.

Type II? Type III?\n    - Effect sums of squares (SSA, SSB, SSAB) are a decomposition of the total sum of squared deviations from the overall mean (SST).\n    - How the SST is decomposed depends on characteristics of the data as well as the hypotheses of interest to the researcher.\n    \n- Type I sums of squares (SS) are based on a sequential decomposition.\n    - For example, if your ANOVA model statement is “MODEL Y = A B A\\*B”, then, the sum of squares are considered in effect order A, B, A*B, with each effect adjusted for all preceding effects in the model.\n    - Thus, any variance that is shared between the various effects will be sub-summed by the variable entered earlier.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Nice property: balanced or not, SS for all the effects add up to the total SS, a complete decomposition of the predicted sums of squares for the whole model. This is not generally true for any other type of sums of squares.\n\n2. Preferable when some factors (such as nesting) should be taken out before other factors. For example, with unequal number of male and female, factor \"gender\" should precede \"subject\" in an unbalanced design.\n\nCons:\n1. Order matters!\n2. Not appropriate for factorial designs, but might be ok for Blocking designs.\n\n\n## Other extensions about 2-way ANOVA: II\n\n-   With Type II SS, each main effect is considered as though it were added after the other main effects but before the interaction.\n    - Any interaction effects are calculated based on a model already containing the main effects.\n    - Any variance that is shared between A and B is not considered part of A or B.\n    - Thus, interaction variance that is shared with A or with B will be counted as part of the main effect, and not as part of the interaction effect.\n\nPros:\n\n1. appropriate for model building, and natural choice for regression\n2. most powerful when there is no interaction\n3. invariant to the order in which effects are entered into the model\n\nCons:\n\n1. For factorial designs with unequal cell samples, Type II sums of squares test hypotheses that are complex functions of the cell ns that ordinarily are not meaningful.\n2. Not appropriate for factorial designs.\n\n\n## Other extensions about 2-way ANOVA: III\n-   Type III SS considers all effects as though they are added last.\n    - Any shared variance ends up not being counted in any of the effects.\n    - In ANOVA, when the data are balanced (equal cell sizes) and the factors are orthogonal and all three types of sums of squares are identical.\n    - Orthogonal, or independent, indicates that there is no variance shared across the various effects, and the separate sums of squares can be added to obtain the model sums of squares.\n\nPros:\n\nNot sample size dependent: effect estimates are not a function of the frequency of observations in any group (i.e., for unbalanced data, where we have unequal numbers of observations in each group).\n\nCons:\n\nNot appropriate for designs with missing cells: for ANOVA designs with missing cells, Type III sums of squares generally do not test hypotheses about least squares means, but instead test hypotheses that are complex functions of the patterns of missing cells in higher-order containing interactions and that are ordinarily not meaningful.\n\n::: rmdnote\nIn general, for the factorial design, we usually report Type III SS, unless you have missing cells in your model.\n:::\n\n\n## Final discussion\n\nIn this example,\n\n  - The interaction effect shows several issues:\n    -   Violation of independency assumption\n    -   Violation of normality assumption in the condition of “Male” and “Tattoo=Yes”\n    \n  - We can guess/think about one possibility that it might be cause by several reasons. (e.g., too small sample sizes, not randomized assignments of the samples, not a significant interaction effect, etc.)\n    -  From the two-way ANOVA results, we found that the interaction effect is not significant.\n\n  - Thus, in this case, it is more reasonable to conduct \n    1. one-way ANOVA for “Group” variable, and \n    2. one-way ANOVA for “Gender” variable, separately.\n    - For each of one-way ANOVAs, we should check the assumptions, conduct\none-way ANOVA, and post-hoc test separately as well.\n\n## Fin",
