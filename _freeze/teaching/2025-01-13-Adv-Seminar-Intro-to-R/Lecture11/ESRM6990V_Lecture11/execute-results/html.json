If you are developing packages that contain only R code, then the tools you need come with R and RStudio.\n    2.  If you want to build packages with compiled C, C++, or Fortran code (or which to build other people’s packages with such code), then you will need to install additional tools.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### MacOS\n\n1.  the Xcode development environment, which comes with the C compiler (`clang`)\n2.  you need a Fortran compiler for older packages containing Fortran code. You can download the GNU Fortran Compiler from the R for Mac tools page.\n\n### Windows\n\n1.  Rtools is a package to build R packages. The [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) package comes in different versions, depending on the version of R that you are using.\n\n### Unix/Linux\n\n1.  No other tools needed for developing R package on Linux/Unix.\n:::\n\n# R Package\n\n::: rmdnote\n[The objectives of this section]{.redcolor}\n\n1.  Recognize the basic structure and purpose of an R package\n2.  Recognize the key directives in a NAMESPACE file\n:::\n\n## Basic Structure of R Package\n\n-   The two required sub-directories are:\n    -   `R`, which contains all of your R code files\n    -   `man`, which contains your documentation files.\n-   At the top level of your package directory, you will have\n    1.  `DESCRIPTION` file\n    2.  `NAMESPACE` file\n-   As an example, this is the file structure of the package `ESRM6990V`:\n\n``` bash\n.\n├── DESCRIPTION\n├── ESRM6990V.Rproj\n├── NAMESPACE\n├── R\n│   └── jihong.R\n├── README.md\n└── man\n    └── jihong.Rd\n```\n\n## `DESCRIPTION` file\n\n1.  The DESCRIPTION file contains key metadata for the package that is used by repositories like CRAN and by R itself.\n\n2.  In particular, this file contains the package name, the version number, the author and maintainer contact information, the license information, as well as any dependencies on other packages.\n\nAs an example, you can check ggplot2's `DESCRIPTION` file on their [github page](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/main/DESCRIPTION).\n\n``` yaml\nPackage: ggplot2\nTitle: Create Elegant Data Visualisations Using the Grammar of Graphics\nVersion: 3.5.1.9000\nAuthors@R: c(\n    person(\"Hadley\", \"Wickham\", , \"hadley@posit.co\", role = \"aut\",\n           comment = c(ORCID = \"0000-0003-4757-117X\")),\n    person(\"Winston\", \"Chang\", role = \"aut\",\n           comment = c(ORCID = \"0000-0002-1576-2126\")),\n    person(\"Lionel\", \"Henry\", role = \"aut\"),\n    person(\"Thomas Lin\", \"Pedersen\", , \"thomas.pedersen@posit.co\", role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"),\n           comment = c(ORCID = \"0000-0002-5147-4711\")),\n    person(\"Kohske\", \"Takahashi\", role = \"aut\"),\n    person(\"Claus\", \"Wilke\", role = \"aut\",\n           comment = c(ORCID = \"0000-0002-7470-9261\")),\n    person(\"Kara\", \"Woo\", role = \"aut\",\n           comment = c(ORCID = \"0000-0002-5125-4188\")),\n    person(\"Hiroaki\", \"Yutani\", role = \"aut\",\n           comment = c(ORCID = \"0000-0002-3385-7233\")),\n    person(\"Dewey\", \"Dunnington\", role = \"aut\",\n           comment = c(ORCID = \"0000-0002-9415-4582\")),\n    person(\"Teun\", \"van den Brand\", role = \"aut\",\n           comment = c(ORCID = \"0000-0002-9335-7468\")),\n    person(\"Posit, PBC\", role = c(\"cph\", \"fnd\"))\n  )\nDescription: A system for 'declaratively' creating graphics, based on \"The\n    Grammar of Graphics\". You provide the data, tell 'ggplot2' how to map\n    variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it\n    takes care of the details.\nLicense: MIT + file LICENSE\nURL: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org, https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2\nBugReports: https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues\nDepends:\n    R (>= 4.0)\nImports: \n    cli,\n```\n\n## `NAMESPACE` file\n\n-   The NAMESPACE file specifies:\n    1.  Exported function that is presented to the user. Functions that are not exported cannot be called directly by the user (although see below).\n    2.  What functions or packages are imported by the package.\n\n::: rmdnote\nIn building R package, you don't need to edit NAMESPACE file manually. You just write up your function by specifying which external functions you imported. `document()` function will automatically create/update NAMESPACE for you.\n:::\n\nAs an example, this is the `NAMESPACE` file for ESRM6990V (see [GitHub](https://github.com/JihongZ/ESRM6990V/blob/main/NAMESPACE)). There is only one function `jihong()` existing that users can call in this package.\n\n``` r\n# Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand\n\nexport(jihong)\n```\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### An example of `mvtsplot` package\n\n``` r\nexport(\"mvtsplot\")\n\nimport(splines)\nimport(RColorBrewer)\nimportFrom(\"grDevices\", \"colorRampPalette\", \"gray\")\nimportFrom(\"graphics\", \"abline\", \"axis\", \"box\", \"image\", \"layout\",\n           \"lines\", \"par\", \"plot\", \"points\", \"segments\", \"strwidth\",\n           \"text\", \"Axis\")\nimportFrom(\"stats\", \"complete.cases\", \"lm\", \"na.exclude\", \"predict\",\n           \"quantile\")\n```\n\nIn this `NAMESPACE` file:\n\n-   `import()`, simply takes a package name as an argument, and the interpretation is that all exported functions from that external package will be accessible to your package\n\n-   `importFrom()`, takes a package and a series of function names as arguments. This directive allows you to specify exactly which function you need from an external package. For example, this package imports the `colorRampPalette()` and `gray()` functions from the `grDevices` package.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Example of same function name from different packages\n\n1.  You may find two R functions from different packages have same names.\n\nFor example, the commonly used dplyr package has a function named filter(), which is also the name of a function in the stats package.\n\n-   In R, every function has a full name, which includes the package namespace as part of the name. This format is along the lines of\n\n``` yaml\n<package name>::<exported function name>\n```\n\nWe can use the following format to call these two functions to avoid confusion\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndplyr::filter()\nstats::filter()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## `R` folder\n\n-   The R sub-directory contains all of your R code, either in a single file, or in multiple files.\n\n-   For larger packages it’s usually best to split code up into multiple files that logically group functions together.\n\n-   The names of the R code files do not matter, but generally it’s not a good idea to have spaces in the file names.\n\nAs an example, I put the function `jihong()` inside of `R/jihong.R` code file.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='jihong.R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#' This is the function for Jihong Zhang\n#'\n#' @param details Want to know more\n#' @returns describe some basic information about Jihong Zhang\n#' @examples\n#' jihong(details = TRUE)\n#' @export\n\njihong <- function(details = FALSE){\n  TEXT <- \"Jihong Zhang is an Assistant Professor at University of Arkansas\"\n  if (details == TRUE) {\n    TEXT <- \"Jihong Zhang currently hold the position of Assistant Professor of Educational Statistics and Research Methods (ESRM) at the department of Counseling, Leadership, and Research Methods (CLRM), University of Arkansas.

You put all of the help information (Title, description, Usage, Arguments, Value, Example) directly in the code where you define each function, with the format `#'`.\n\n2.  You call `document()` or click `Build` \\> `document`, the roxygen2 package will convert the help information into `.Rd` files.\n\n3.  These help files will ultimately be moved to a folder called `/man` of your package, in an R documentation format (.Rd file extensions) that is fairly similar to LaTeX.\n\n## Help files: Tags\n\n-   the `roxygen2` package lets you put all of the help information directly in the code where you define each function. Further, `roxygen2` documentation allows you to include tags (`@export`, `@importFrom`) that will automate writing the package NAMESPACE file, so you don’t need to edit that file by hand.\n\n-   In our example, the following code starting with `@` is called tags:\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    #' This is the function for showing the information of XXX\n    #'\n    #' @param details Want to know more\n    #' \n    #' @returns describe some basic information about XXX\n    #' \n    #' @examples\n    #' hello()\n    #' \n    #' @export\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n\n\nSome frequently used key tags:\n\n1.  `@export` : Export the function, so users will have direct access to it when they load the package\n2.  `@param`: Explanation of a function parameter. `@param [param_name] [explanation]`\n3.  `@examples` : Example code showing how to use the function\n4.  `@return` : A description of the object returned by the function\n\nYou can find the full list of tags in roxygen2's documentation ([here](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/reference/index.html)).\n\n## Store Data in Package\n\n-   If you want to store R objects and make them available to the user, put them in `data/`. This is the best place to put example datasets. All the concrete examples above for data in a package and data as a package use this mechanism.\n\n-   If you want to store R objects for your own use as a developer, put them in `R/sysdata.rda`. This is the best place to put internal data that your functions need.\n\n-   If you want to store data in some raw, non-R-specific form and make it available to the user, put it in `inst/extdata/`.\n\n-   If you want to store dynamic data that reflects the internal state of your package within a single R session, use an environment. This technique is not as common or well-known as those above, but can be very useful in specific situations.\n\n-   If you want to store data persistently across R sessions, such as configuration or user-specific data, use one of the officially sanctioned locations.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Example 1: Store your data into your package\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### Step 4: Create Dataset.R\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::use_data_raw(name = \"Dataset\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n![](images/clipboard-3638710880.png)\n\n#### Step 5: Create R script for data generation\n\nIn `Dataset.R` file, put the following R code into R file.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat <- data.frame(\n  name = \"jihong\",\n  bio = \"\nI am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Educational Statistics and Research Methods (ESRM) in the Department of Counseling, Leadership, and Research Methods (CLRM) at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, U.S.\n\nPreviously, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Social Work at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). My academic journey in psychometrics began with doctoral training under Dr. Jonathan Templin in the Educational Measurement and Statistics (EMS) program at the University of Iowa. I have extensive experience in educational assessment. During my master’s program at the University of Kansas, I worked as a research assistant for three years in the Kansas Assessment Program (KAP), contributing to various assessment initiatives, including Dynamic Learning Maps (DLM). Later, during my Ph.D. program, I interned at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), where I focused on digital learning in computerized testing.\n\nMy primary research interests include empirical and methodological studies in psychological network modeling, AI in Education, Bayesian latent variable modeling, Item Response Theory modeling, and other advanced psychometric methods.

Do you see the data in your menu?\n\n![](images/clipboard-553801648.png)\n\n#### Step 7: Share your package\n\nCurrently, you can compress your package and share the zip file to anyone you want to share with.\n\nAs an example, download jeremy.zip on the [webpage of Syllabus](https://jihongzhang.org/teaching/2025-01-13-Adv-Seminar-Intro-to-R/ESRM6990V_syllabus.html#schedule). Unzip it to `Downloads` folder and run the following R script.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"~/Downloads/jeremy\", repos = NULL, type=\"source\")\n>> Installing package into ‘/Users/jihong/Rlibs’\n>> (as ‘lib’ is unspecified)\n>> * installing *source* package ‘jeremy’ ...\n>> ** using staged installation\n>> ** R\n>> ** data\n>> *** moving datasets to lazyload DB\n>> ** byte-compile and prepare package for lazy loading\n>> ** help\n>> *** installing help indices\n>> ** building package indices\n>> ** testing if installed package can be loaded from temporary location\n>> ** testing if installed package can be loaded from final location\n>> ** testing if installed package keeps a record of temporary installation path\n>> * DONE (jeremy)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n## More about R Package\n\nWe've learnt how to build a simplest R package. However, today class is scratching the surface of R package. There are more things when you build your more complicated package. Some of which are:\n\n-   Create unit tests for an R package using the testthat package\n-   Categorize errors in the R CMD check process\n-   Recall the principles of open source software\n-   Recall two open source licenses\n-   Create create a GitHub repository for an R package\n-   Create an R package that is tested and deployed on Travis\n-   Create an R package that is tested and deployed on Appveyor\n-   Recognize characteristics of R packages that are not cross-platform\n\nYou can take a look at the Reference slide if you want to know more.\n\n## Reference\n\n1.
