My academic journey in psychometrics starts with a doctoral training with [Dr. Jonathan Templin](https://jonathantemplin.com/) in the Educational Measurement and Statistics (EMS) program at the University of Iowa.\n\nMy primary research focuses on empirical and methodological studies on psychological/psychometric network modeling, Bayesian latent variable modeling, Item Response Theory modeling, and other advanced psychometric modeling. My expertise lies in the application of advanced statistical modeling in the fields of psychology and education.\n\n[![](images/dog.png){width=\"20\"} LEARN MORE ABOUT ME →](about.qmd)\n:::\n",
