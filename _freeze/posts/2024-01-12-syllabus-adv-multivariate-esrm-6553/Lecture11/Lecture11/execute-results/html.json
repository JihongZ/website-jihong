Show how to estimate unidimensional latent variable models with polytomous data\n    -   Also know as [Polytomous]{.underline} I[tem response theory]{.underline} (IRT) or [Item factor analysis]{.underline} (IFA)\n2.  Distributions appropriate for polytomous (discrete; data with lower/upper limits)\n\n## Today's Lecture Objectives\n\n1.  How to model multidimensional factor structures\n2.  Show how to estimate models with missing data\n\n## Example Data: Conspiracy Theories\n\n-   Today's example is from a bootstrap resample of 177 undergraduate students at a large state university in the Midwest.\n-   The survey was a measure of 10 questions about their beliefs in various conspiracy theories that were being passed around the internet in the early 2010s\n-   All item responses were on a 5-point Likert scale with:\n    1.  Strong Disagree\n    2.  Disagree\n    3.  Neither Agree nor Disagree\n    4.  Agree\n    5.  Strongly Agree\n-   The purpose of this survey was to study individual beliefs regarding conspiracies.\n-   Our purpose in using this instrument is to provide a context that we all may find relevant as many of these conspiracies are still prevalent.\n\n# Multidimensionality\n\n## More than one Latent Variable - Latent Parameter Space\n\nWe need to create latent variables by specifying which items measure which latent variables in an analysis model\n\n-   This procedure Called different names by different fields:\n\n    -   Alignment (education measurement)\n\n    -   Factor pattern matrix (factor analysis)\n\n    -   Q-matrix (Question matrix; diagnostic models and multidimensional IRT)\n\n## From Q-matrix to Model\n\nThe alignment provides a specification of which latent variables are measured by which items\n\n-   Sometimes we say items \"load onto\" factors\n\nThe math definition of either of these terms is simply whether or not a latent variable appears as a predictor for an item\n\n-   For instance, item one appears to measure nongovernment conspiracies, meaning its alignment (row vector of the Q-matrix)\n\n    ```{.r}\n             Gov NonGov \n    item1     0      1 \n    ```\n\n# Missing Data\n\n## Dealing with Missing Data in Stan\n\nIf you ever attempted to analyze missing data in `Stan`, you likely received an error message:\n\n`Error: Variable 'Y' has NA values.`\n\nThat is because, by default, `Stan` does not model missing data\n\n-   Instead, we have to get `Stan` to work with the data we have (the values that are not missing)\n\n-   That does not mean remove cases where any observed variables are missing\n\n## Example Missing Data\n\nTo make things a bit easier, I'm only turning one value into missing data (the first person's response to the first item)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Import data ===============================================================================\ndat <- read.csv(here(root_dir, 'conspiracies.csv'))\nconspiracyItems <- dat[,1:10]\ncolnames(conspiracyItems) <- paste0('item', 1:10)\n\n# make some cases missing for demonstration:\nconspiracyItems[1,1] = NA\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNote that all code will work with as missing as you have\n\n-   Observed variables do have to have some values that are not missing\n\n## Resources\n\n-   [Dr. Templin's slide](https://jonathantemplin.github.io/Bayesian-Psychometric-Modeling-Course-Fall2022/lectures/lecture04d/04d_Modeling_Observed_Polytomous_Data#/binomial-model-data-block)\n",
