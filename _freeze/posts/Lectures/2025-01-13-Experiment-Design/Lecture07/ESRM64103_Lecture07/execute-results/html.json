Still, we want to take to these differences into account statistically.\n-   **2. Factorial design: design with more than one IV**\n    -   Two treatment factors that interact. e.g., gender (Male vs. Female) x age (Childhood vs. Youth)\n\n## In this week\n\n-   **We used a one-way ANOVA to compare means of two or more groups**\n    -   Ex. Effect of tutoring on student grades\n    -   One categorical independent variable (three groups: no tutor, once/week, daily)\n    -   One continuous dependent variable (grades)\n-   **What if we want to examine another independent variable?**\n    -   Ex. Type of school setting: Public, private-secular, and private-religious\n    -   That is, we think the effect of tutoring on grades might depend on the school setting, so we want to control for school setting.\n-   **We can use ANOVA with more than one IV in this case**\n    -   Two or more categorical independent variables (factors)\n    -   One continuous dependent variable\n\n## In this week\n\n-   **Offers several advantages over a one-way ANOVA:** **1. Allows for greater generalizability of results** - More realistic (life is complex!)\n    -   Allows for investigation of interactions → through FACTORIAL ANOVA **1. We can ask whether the effect of one variable depends on the level of** **another variable** - Ex. cancer trials; Does the effect of the treatment method depend on stage of cancer? - Economy: requires fewer participants than two one-way designs for the same level of power. **2. Smaller error terms means we have more power**\n\n## In this week\n\n-   **Adding an IV in ANOVA is more powerful than a one-way ANOVA because** **we are able to account for more of the variance by adding additional factors**\n    -   For example, let’s say we are interested in tutoring type on grades, but we already think that school type also affects performance\n\n![](images/clipboard-3940876064.png)\n\n-   Adding school type as an IV explains more variance, thus reducing the amount of error variance\n-   Remember we define error as anything NOT explained by the IVs\n\n## Blocking\n\n-   **Blocking factors** and **nuisance factors** provide the mechanism for explaining and controlling variation among the experimental units from sources that are not of interest and part of the error.\n-   **Block designs help maintain internal validity** , by reducing the possibility that the observed effects are due to a **confounding factor.**\n    -   Confounding factor = a factor which impacts on both IV and DV\n-   While also **maintaining external validity** by allowing the investigator to use less stringent restrictions on the sampling population.\n-   **When we have a single blocking factor: utilize a randomized complete block** **design (RCBD).**\n    -   cf. completely randomized design (CRD) = cares about the randomly assigned treatment\n    -   Randomized completed block design (RCBE) = CRD with the blocking\n-   Today, will see extensions when more than a single blocking factor exists\n    -   Ex. Latin Squares and their generalizations\n-   These designs are efficient in terms of power and reducing the error variation.\n\n## Why Use Blocking - Confounding Variables\n\n-   In designing a study, researchers need to anticipate the factors that could undermine the **validity** of the inferences.\n    -   Validity is defined as “[the approximate truth of an inference]{.redcolor}” (Shadish, Cook, & Campbell, 2002). Validity is a property of the inferences, not of the research design.\n    -   However, design elements can have a profound impact on the inferences we make.\n-   Many threats to validity involve inadequate control over **confounding variables**.\n    -   A confounding variable is an “extra” variable that the researcher did not account for.\n    -   **Confounding variables:** are any other variable that also has an effect on your dependent variable. They are like extra independent variables that are having a hidden effect on your dependent variables.\n        -   They can ruin an experiment and give provide the researcher with misleading results.\n-   Confounding variables that are not controlled for can suggest there is correlation when in fact there is not or even introduce bias, leading the researcher to find an F-statistic that is too low or too high.\n-   For these reasons, it is important to know what a confounding variables is, and how to avoid getting them into your experiment in the first place.\n    -   One approach to dealing with confounding variables is through **blocking**.\n\n## When to use this tool\n\n-   Use ANOVA with Blocking to evaluate the equality of three or more means from dependent/related populations. This test basically performs a one-way ANOVA after accounting for the variability among the 'blocks'. Blocks are groups of similar units or repeated measurements on the same unit. ANOVA with blocking is therefore a multiple-sample application of the paired samples t-test.\n\n-   The test makes the following assumptions:\n\n    -   The data are continuous numeric.\n    -   The units are randomly sampled.\n    -   No interaction between the 'treatments' and 'blocks'.\n    -   The groups are normally distributed.\n    -   The groups have equal variances.\n\n## Blocking Factor and Nuisance Factor\n\n::::: columns\n::: column\n-   **Example: Age and Gender**\n    -   In studies involving human subjects, **we often use gender** **and age as the blocking factors.**\n    -   We partition our subjects by gender and from there into age groups.\n    -   Thus, we have **a block of** **homogeneous subjects** defined by the combination of factors, gender and age.\n    -   Within each block, we then randomly assign to treatment(T) or control(C).\n-   **Example: Age classes and gender** → **The key is that age, gender are not a part of our experimental design.**\n    -   As we saw, we often use gender and age classes as the blocking factors.\n:::\n\n::: column\n![](images/clipboard-3855292435.png)\n:::\n:::::\n\n## Blocking Factor and Nuisance Factor\n\n-   Sometimes, confounding variables are **nuisance factor**[^1]\n\n    -   **Nuisance factor**: A factor that probably has an effect on the outcome, but is not a factor that we are interested in.\n\n    -   E.g., Age, Institution, Sites\n\n-   **Another Example: Institution (size, location, type, etc)**\n\n    -   In medical studies, one blocking factor commonly used is the type of institution.\n        -   Hopefully removes institutionally-related factors such as size of the institution, types of populations served, hospitals versus clinics, etc.\n        -   We expect that these factors would influence the overall results of the experiment.\n        -   We are not manipulating institution – this is what makes it a nuisance factor\n\n-   So, nuisance factor (variables that can impact on DV, but not the interest of)\n\n    -   If the nuisance factor is known and controllable, we can use “**blocking**.” and nuisance factors become blocking factors (manipulate the block factors to make treatment samples homogenous)\n    -   If the nuisance factor is known, but uncontrollable, we considers **ANCOVA**. (gender, class, school)\n    -   If the nuisance factor is unknown and uncontrollable (i.e., lurking variable), we re-do the randomization.\n\n[^1]: PennStat STAT503: https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat503/lesson/4/4.1\n\n## Types of nuisance factors:\n\n![](images/clipboard-2431159556.png)\n\n## Example\n\n-   We are interested in the performance of four lecture method on math scores.\n-   The following math test scores (higher score = better at math) were obtained for three test forms.\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n| Lecture  | Form 1 | Form 2 | Form 3 |\n|----------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Method 1 | 45     | 43     | 51     |\n| Method 2 | 47     | 46     | 52     |\n| Method 3 | 48     | 50     | 55     |\n| Method 4 | 42     | 37     | 49     |\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n-   In this scenario:\n    -   We are interested in lecture method → This is our **IV**\n    -   Test form may have an effect, but we are not interested in it. → Form is the blocking factor\n    -   The outcome is math test score → This is the DV\n    -   Here, all lecture types are applied to all forms\n:::\n:::::\n\n-   this is called a **“complete” block design**. → Let’s look at blocking design variations.\n\n## 1. Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD)\n\n-   The mean comparison among specific blocks ($\\mu_{form1}$, $\\mu_{form2}$, $\\mu_{form3}$, $\\mu_{form4}$) is not of interest\n    -   In a RCBD, the variation between blocks is partitioned out of the MSE, resulting in a smaller MSE for testing hypotheses about the treatments.\n\n$$\nY_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\rho_j + \\epsilon_{ij}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n1.  $Y_{ij}$: math scores for Method *i* and Form *j*\n2.  $\\mu$: grand mean\n3.  $\\tau_i$: Method *i* with *i* = 1, ..., 4\n4.  $\\rho_j$: From *j* with *j* = 1, 2, 3\n5.  $\\rho_j$ and $\\epsilon_{ij}$ are independent random variables such that $\\rho_j \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2_{\\rho})$ and $\\epsilon_{ij} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2_{\\epsilon})$\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## 1.1 Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD)\n\n-   When we have a single blocking factor (Form): utilize a [randomized complete block design]{.bluecolor} (RCBD)[^2].\n-   *b* blocks, each with *a* treatment levels\n    -   *a* treatment levels are randomly assigned within each block\n-   In this case, we have 3 blocks ([Form 1]{.red}, [Form 2]{.green}, [Form 3]{.purple}) with each having 4 treatment levels (Method 1 vs. 2 vs. 3 vs. 4).\n\n[^2]: PennStat [STAT502](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat502/lesson/7/7.3)\n\n| Lecture  |   Form 1   |    Form 2    |    Form 3     |\n|----------|:----------:|:------------:|:-------------:|\n| Method 1 | [45]{.red} | [43]{.green} | [51]{.purple} |\n| Method 2 | [47]{.red} | [46]{.green} | [52]{.purple} |\n| Method 3 | [48]{.red} | [50]{.green} | [55]{.purple} |\n| Method 4 | [42]{.red} | [37]{.green} | [49]{.purple} |\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n-   Numbers in each cell are means\n-   Blocks for each form; within each block, we have each level of the IV\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n+------------+--------------+----------------+------------------+------------+\n| Lecture    | Form 1       | Form 2         | Form 3           | Marginal   |\n+============+:============:+:==============:+:================:+:==========:+\n| Method 1   | [45]{.red}   | [43]{.green}   | [51]{.purple}    | 46.33      |\n+------------+--------------+----------------+------------------+------------+\n| Method 2   | [47]{.red}   | [46]{.green}   | [52]{.purple}    | 48.33      |\n+------------+--------------+----------------+------------------+------------+\n| Method 3   | [48]{.red}   | [50]{.green}   | [55]{.purple}    | 51.00      |\n+------------+--------------+----------------+------------------+------------+\n| Method 4   | [42]{.red}   | [37]{.green}   | [49]{.purple}    | 42.67      |\n+------------+--------------+----------------+------------------+------------+\n| Marginal   | [46.3]{.red} | [44.0]{.green} | [51.75]{.purple} |            |\n+------------+--------------+----------------+------------------+------------+\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nexp <- tribble(\n  ~method, ~F1, ~F2, ~F3,\n  1, 45,43,51,\n  2, 47,46,52,\n  3, 48,50,55,\n  4, 42,37,49\n)\n\nexp_l <- exp |> \n  mutate(method = factor(method, levels = 1:4)) |> \n  pivot_longer(F1:F3, names_to = \"block\", values_to = \"score\")\nsummary(aov(score ~ block + method, data = exp_l))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value  Pr(>F)   \nblock        2 135.17   67.58   21.53 0.00183 **\nmethod       3 110.92   36.97   11.78 0.00631 **\nResiduals    6  18.83    3.14                   \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nstats::TukeyHSD(aov(score ~ block + method, data = exp_l))$method |> round(2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n     diff    lwr   upr p adj\n2-1  2.00  -3.01  7.01  0.55\n3-1  4.67  -0.34  9.67  0.07\n4-1 -3.67  -8.67  1.34  0.15\n3-2  2.67  -2.34  7.67  0.34\n4-2 -5.67 -10.67 -0.66  0.03\n4-3 -8.33 -13.34 -3.33  0.00\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## 2. Latin Square Design\n\n-   Allow for **two blocking factors**.\n    -   Used to simultaneously control (or eliminate) two sources of nuisance variability.\n-   **Latin Square Design** gets its name from the fact that we can write it as a square with Latin letters to correspond to the treatments.\n    -   The treatment factor levels are the Latin letters in the Latin square design.\n    -   The number of rows and columns correspond to the number of treatment levels.\n    -   So, if we have four treatments then we would need to have four rows and four columns in order to create a Latin square.\n\n## 2. Latin Square Design\n\n-   Comparing RCBD, or CRD, Latin square design has two nuisance factors.\n-   Each treatment occurs only once in each row and once in each column.\n-   We assume that three factors (factor of the interest, two nuisance factors) are not interacting with each other.\n-   Within each cell, we have multiple people.\n    -   → A=Lecture Type 1, B=Lecture Type 2, C=Lecture Type 3, D=Lecture Type 4\n\n|          | Form 1 | Form 2 | Form 3 | Form 4 |\n|:--------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|\n| School 1 |   A    |   D    |   C    |   B    |\n| School 2 |   B    |   A    |   D    |   C    |\n| School 3 |   C    |   B    |   A    |   D    |\n| School 4 |   D    |   C    |   B    |   A    |\n\n: {.hover .stripped}\n\n# 2.

High scores on the PCB indicate\n          higher levels of unhealthy coping behaviors. Low scores indicate low levels\n          of unhealthy coping behaviors. PCB scores can range from 0 (no unhealthy\n          behaviors) to 100 (multiple unhealthy behaviors at high frequency and high\n          intensity).\n       ✓ The researcher thinks that the health promotion programs for nursing\n          students may have an effect on academic and well-being outcomes.\n       ✓ However, gender and status (traditional vs. non-traditional student)\n          differences may influence the effectiveness of health promotion programs.\n\n\n# Blocking: Example -> 2 Blocking Factors?\n\n- The researcher has a sample of 200 nursing students from the state of Arkansas.\n    50 students are assigned to each program: Program A, Program B, and Program\n    C.
