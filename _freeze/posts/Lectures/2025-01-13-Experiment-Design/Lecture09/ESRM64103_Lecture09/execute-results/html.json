When comparing the means of DV among several groups *with more than two IVs*, we can use :\n    i)  Blocking Design\n        -   Independent variable: the factor of the interest (→ the factor that we expect to have any meaningful impact on the dependent variable)\n        -   Extraneous factor → the factors that impacts on DV\n\n::: callout-note\n1.  If one of [extraneous factors]{style=\"color:tomato\"} is expected to have any impact on IV as well, then, it is treated as \"[confounding]{style=\"color:purple\"}\" factor\n2.  If one of [extraneous factors]{style=\"color:tomato\"} is NOT expected to have any impact on IV, then, it is treated as \"[nuisance]{style=\"color:royalblue\"}\" factor\n    i)  If the [nuisance]{style=\"color:royalblue\"} variable is [known]{style=\"color:green; font-weight:bold\"} and [controllable]{style=\"color:green; font-weight:bold\"} (e.g., schools, classes, farms), we use blocking and control it by including a “blocking” factor in our experiment.\n    ii) If the [nuisance]{style=\"color:royalblue\"} factor is [known]{style=\"color:green; font-weight:bold\"} but [uncontrollable]{style=\"color:red; font-weight:bold\"} (e.g., age), sometimes we can use analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to remove the effect of the [nuisance]{style=\"color:royalblue\"} factor from the analysis.\n    iii) If the [nuisance]{style=\"color:royalblue\"} factors that are [unknown]{style=\"color:red; font-weight:bold\"} and [uncontrollable]{style=\"color:red; font-weight:bold\"} (sometimes called a “lurking” variable; e.g., teachers' personality/emotions). We use randomization to balance out their impact.\n3.  Generally, we assume that the independent variable and the blocking variable(s) are independent to each other; that is, we do not care about the interaction between these two variables.\\\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Types of Factorial Design\n\n2.  When we are interested in comparing the means of dependent variable among several groups **with more than two independent variables**:\n3.  **Factorial Design**\n    -   Independent or between-subject design\n        -   Each individual is in only 1 group or receives only 1 treatment\n    -   Dependent and/or repeated-measure design\n        -   Each individual is in each of the groups or receives each of the treatments\n    -   Mixed design (e.g., split-plot design, etc.)\n        -   For one IV, each individual is in 1 group or receives 1 treatment\n        -   For the other IV, each individual is in each of the groups or receives each of the treatments\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Examples of multiple-way ANOVA\n\n-   For 2 IVs, each person only 1 group = two-way independent ANOVA\n-   For 3 IVs, each person receives each treatment = three-way repeated measures ANOVA\n-   For 2 IVs, each person receives 1 treatment for 1 IV and each treatment for other IV = two-way mixed ANOVA\n\nNote. “A (number of IVs)=way (type of design) ANOVA” → Number of IVs- the name changes with each additional factor:\n:::\n\n## Difference of Factorial Design\n\n| Design Type | Key Feature | Example | Statistical Analysis |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Split-Plot | Hierarchical treatment assignment (whole plots and subplots) | Agriculture: Irrigation (whole plot) & Fertilizer (subplot) | Mixed-effects model |\n| Independent | Each participant/unit is exposed to one condition only | Teaching Method 1 vs. Method 2 | Independent t-test, ANOVA |\n| Dependent | Same participant/unit exposed to all conditions | Measuring reaction time with different caffeine levels | Repeated-measures ANOVA, mixed-effects model |\n\n:::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"33%\"}\n![](images/plot1.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"33%\"}\n![](images/plot2.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"33%\"}\n![](images/plot3.png)\n:::\n::::::\n\n## Next lectures III\n\n:::::: callout-important\n## Example of Factorial Design\n\n-   Research Question: Is there an interaction between school type and tutoring program on academic achievement?\n    -   For this RQ, we might think that the effect of tutoring program depends on the type of school the students attend.\n    -   As shown below, there are three levels for the tutoring program (e.g., no tutor, once a week, and daily) and three levels for the school type (e.g., public, private-secular, and private-religious).\n    -   Then, we examine ALL combinations of the levels of these two IVs.\n\n::::: columns\n::: column\n| School\\\\Program   | No Tutor | Once Per Week | Daily |\n|-------------------|----------|---------------|-------|\n| Public            | Y11      | Y12           | Y13   |\n| Private-secular   | Y21      | Y22           | Y23   |\n| Private-religious | Y31      | Y32           | Y33   |\n:::\n\n::: column\n-   This would be a 3 x 3 design: two factors, one with 3 levels and one with 3 levels\n    -   3 levels of tutoring program\n    -   3 levels of school type\n-   Complete term: 3 x 3 two-way ANOVA or 3 x 3 independent factorial ANOVA\n:::\n:::::\n::::::\n\n## Next lectures IV: Exercise\n\n::: callout-caution\n## Example of Factorial Design\n\n*Question*: **What kind of design is used in the following research question:**\n\n-   Does the effect of three different [drug treatments]{style=\"color:red; font-weight:bold\"} (separate groups for Drug A, Drug B, Placebo) on the level of self-reported [positive mood]{style=\"color:green;font-weight:bold\"} depend on whether the participant received [psychotherapy]{style=\"color:purple; font-weight:bold\"} (treatment group) treatment or not (control group)?\n    A.

A different sample of students was taken each semester?\n    A.  3 x 3 x 4 independent factorial ANOVA\n    B.  3 x 3 x 4 split-plot factorial ANOVA\n    C.  3 x 4 independent factorial ANOVA\n    D.  3 x 4 repeated-measure factorial ANOVA\n-   Answer: [A]{.mohu}\n    -   [We have three IVs; school, semester, and cohort; school has three levels (UA, UAFS, UALR), semester has three levels (Fall, Spring, Summer), and cohort has four levels (2012, 2013, 2014, 2015).]{.mohu}\n    -   [And this design does not have the dependent (or repeated-measure) components, because “the different sample of students was taken from each semester.”]{.mohu}\n    -   [Generally, the smaller number of levels comes the first.]{.mohu}\n    -   [So, this is an example of 3 x 3 x 4 independent factorial ANOVA.]{.mohu}\n:::\n\n## Advantages of Factorial Design I\n\n-   Factorial design offers several advantages over a one-way ANOVA:\n    1.  It allows for greater generalizability of results\n        -   More realistic (**external validity**)\n        -   Example: One study of using participants with the age groups including Youth and Childhood vs. One study using only Youth\n    2.  It allows for investigation of interactions (**answer more complicated RQs**)\n        -   We can ask whether the effect of one variable depends on the level of another variable\n        -   Example: cancer trials; *Does the effect of treatment method depends on stage of cancer?*\n    3.  It requires fewer participants than two 1-way treatment designs for the same level of statistical power.\n        -   Smaller error terms means more statistical power!\n\n## Advantages of Factorial Design II\n\n::: callout-important\n-   For example, let’s say we are interested in testing the effect of level of arousal (e.g., anxiety) on math performance, but we already think that gender is associated with performance.\n    -   Adding gender as an IV explains more variance, thus, reducing the amount of error variance of DV.\n    -   **Note.** We define error as anything NOT related to (explained by) the IVs.\\\n:::\n\n![](images/plot4.png)\n\n## Steps for conducting two-way ANOVA\n\n-   **Similar to one-way ANOVA**:\n    1.  Set the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis → Research question?\n    2.  Find the critical value of test statistics (i.e., F-critical) based on alpha and df\n    3.  Calculate the observed value of test statistics (i.e., F-observed) based on the information about the collected data (i.e., the sample)\n    4.  Make the statistical conclusion → either reject or retain the null hypothesis\n    5.  State the research conclusion regarding the research question\n\n## Hypothesis testing for two-way ANOVA (I)\n\n-   For two-way ANOVA, there are three distinct hypothesis tests :\n    -   Main effect of Factor A\n    -   Main effect of Factor B\n    -   Interaction of A and B\n\n::: callout-note\nThree separate F-tests are conducted for each!\n:::\n\nMain effect\n\n:   Occurs when there is a difference between levels for one factor\n\nInteraction\n\n:   Occurs when the effect of one factor on the DV depends on the particular level of the other factor\n\n:   Said another way, when the difference in one factor is moderated by the other\n\n:   Said a third way, if the difference between levels of one factor is different, depending on the other factor\n\n## Hypothesis testing for two-way ANOVA (II)\n\n::: callout-important\n## Example\n\n**Background**: A researcher is investigating how study method (Factor A: Lecture vs. Interactive) and test format (Factor B: Multiple-Choice vs. Open-Ended) affect student performance (dependent variable: test scores). The study involves randomly assigning students to one of the two study methods and then assessing their performance on one of the two test formats.\n\n-   **Main Effect of Study Method (Factor A):**\n    -   [H0:]{style=\"color:royalblue; font-weight:bold\"} There is no difference in test scores between students who used the Lecture method and those who used the Interactive method.\n    -   [H1:]{style=\"color:tomato; font-weight:bold\"} There is a significant difference in test scores between the two study methods.\n-   **Main Effect of Test Format (Factor B):**\n    -   [H0:]{style=\"color:royalblue; font-weight:bold\"} There is no difference in test scores between students taking a Multiple-Choice test and those taking an Open-Ended test.\n    -   [H1:]{style=\"color:tomato; font-weight:bold\"} There is a significant difference in test scores between the two test formats.\n-   **Interaction Effect (Study Method × Test Format):**\n    -   [H0:]{style=\"color:royalblue; font-weight:bold\"} The effect of study method on test scores is the same regardless of test format.\n    -   [H1:]{style=\"color:tomato; font-weight:bold\"} The effect of study method on test scores depends on the test format (i.e., there is an interaction).\n:::\n\n## Hypothesis testing for two-way ANOVA (III)\n\n1.  Hypothesis test for the main effect with more than 2 levels\n    -   Mean differences among levels of one factor:\n\n        i)  Differences are tested for statistical significance\n        ii) Each factor is evaluated independently of the other factor(s) in the study\n\n    -   Factor A’s Main effect: “Controlling Factor B, are there differences in the DV across Factor A?”\n\n        $H_0$: $\\mu_{A_1}=\\mu_{A_2}=\\cdots=\\mu_{A_k}$\n\n        $H_1$: At least one $\\mu_{A_i}$ is different from the control group in Factor A\n\n    -   Factor B’s Main effect : “Controlling Factor A, are there differences in the DV across Factor B?”\n\n        $H_0$: $\\mu_{B_1}=\\mu_{B_2}=\\cdots=\\mu_{B_k}$\n\n        $H_1$: At least one $\\mu_{B_i}$ is different from the control group in Factor A\n\n::: callout-caution\n**Question**: what dose \"controlling\" mean in “Controlling Factor A, ...\"?\n\n**Answer**: [\"Controlling\" means the decrease of error variances by incorporating the effects of factor A on outcome?]{.mohu}\n:::\n\n## Hypothesis testing for two-way ANOVA (IV)\n\n::: callout-note\n## Example\n\n-   **Question**: What are the null and alternative hypotheses for the main effects in the example?:\n-   **Research purpose**: to examine the effect of tutoring program (no tutor, once a week, and daily) AND types of school (e.g., public, private-secular, and private-religious) on the students’ grades\n    -   Factor A’s Main effect: “[Controlling school types, are there differences in the students’ grade across three tutoring programs?]{.mohu}”\n\n        $H_0$: $\\mu_{\\mathrm{no\\ tutor}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{once\\ a\\ week}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{daily}}$\n\n    -   Factor B’s Main effect : “[Controlling tutoring programs, are there differences in the students’ grades across three school types?]{.mohu}”\n\n        $H_0$: $\\mu_{\\mathrm{public}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{private-religious}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{private-secular}}$\n:::\n",
