A **data.frame** with data to be plotted\n    -   `ggplot(data = ...)`\n2.  The unquoted **variables** name (columns of `data.frame`) that will be *mapped* to different **aesthetics** of the graph (e.g. axis, colors, shapes, etc.)\n    -   `mapping = aes(x = ..., y=..., color=....)`\n3.  the **geometry** that will be drawn on the graph (e.g. points, lines, boxplots, violinplots, etc.)\n    -   `geom_points()` or `geom_path()`\n\nThis translates into the following generic basic syntax:\n\n``` r\nggplot(data = <data.frame>, \n       mapping = aes(x = <column of data.frame>, \n                     y = <column of data.frame>)) +\ngeom_<type of geometry>()\n```\n\n## First Visualization\n\n-   The question[^1] we're interested in is:\n    -   **Q1**: How much separation is there between different world regions in terms of *family size and life expectancy?*\n-   Since both family size and life expectancy are continuous, we can explore this by using a [scatterplot](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/scatter.html) showing the relationship[^2] between `children_per_woman` and `life_expectancy`.\n-   Let's do it step-by-step to see how `ggplot2` works.\n\n[^1]: For our first visualization, let's try to recreate one of the visualizations from [Hans Rosling's talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare).\n\n[^2]: For two categorical variables, which figure is suitable?\n\n---\n\n- 1. Start by giving data to `ggplot`:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = gapminder2010) # <1>\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.  We replace `<data.frame>` with the object name of the target data frame\n\nThat \"worked\" (as in, we didn't get an error). But because we didn't give `ggplot()` any variables/columns to be mapped to *aesthetic* components of the graph, we just got an empty square or a blank canvas.\n\n---\n\n- 2. For **mappping columns to aesthetics**, we use the `aes()` function:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = gapminder2010, \n       mapping = aes(x = children_per_woman, # <2>\n                     y = life_expectancy)) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n2.  We replaced `<column of the data.frame>` with the unquoted column name\n\n\n\nThat's better, now we have x-axis and y-axis, which correspond to faimily size (*column name*: `children_per_woman`) and life expectancy (*column name*: `life_expectancy`).\n\nNotice how `ggplot()` defines the axis based on the range of data given. But it's still not a very interesting graph, because we didn't tell what it is we want to draw on the graph.\n\n---\n\n- 3. This is done by adding (literally `+`) **geometries** to our graph. For example, scatterplot use the \"point\" to represent data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = gapminder2010, \n       mapping = aes(x = children_per_woman, \n                     y = life_expectancy)) + #<3>\n  geom_point() # <4>\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.  `+` add up a new layer onto the old layers\n4.  We replace `geom_<type of geometry>()` with `geom_point()`\n\n::: callout-important\nNotice how `geom_point()` warns you that it had to remove some missing values (if the data is missing for at least one of the variables, then it cannot plot the points).\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Exercise-01: geometry of missingness\n\n::::: {.panel-tabset}\n## Exercise\n\n[Aim]{.redcolor}: It would be useful to explore the pattern of missing data in these two variables. The `naniar` package provides a ggplot geometry that allows us to do this, by replacing `NA` values with values 10% lower than the minimum in the variable.\n\nTry and modify the previous graph, using the `geom_miss_point()` from this package. (hint: don't forget to load the package first using `library(naniar)`)\n\n[Questions]{.redcolor}: What can you conclude from this exploration? Are the data missing at random?\n\n## Trick: Fast Installation of Package\n\nTo open a \"Install Packages\" window below, press {{<kbd mac=Command+Shift+P win=Ctrl+Shift+P >}} and then search \"Install\" in the dropdown menu.\n\n![](images/clipboard-3351367957.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"250\"}\n\n\n\n\n## Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(naniar) # load the naniar package; this should be placed on top of the script\nggplot(data = gapminder2010, \n       mapping = aes(x = children_per_woman, y = life_expectancy)) +\n  geom_miss_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-   The data do not seem to be missing at random (MAR):\n    1.  it seems to be the case that when data is missing for one variable it is often also missing for the other.\n    2.  And there seem to be more missing data for `children_per_woman` than `life_expectancy`.\n    3.  However, we only have 9 cases with missing data, so perhaps we should not make very strong conclusions from this. But it gives us more questions that we could follow up on: are the countries with missing data generaly lacking other statistics? Is it harder to obtain data for fertility than for life expectancy?\n:::::\n\n## A (not full) list of geometries in ggplot2\n\n-   Here is a list of some frequently used geometries[^3]:\n\n    -   `geom_area()` draws an area plot, which is a line plot filled to the y-axis (filled lines). Multiple groups will be stacked on top of each other.\n\n    -   `geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")` makes a bar chart. We need stat = \"identity\" because the default stat automatically counts values (so is essentially a 1d geom, see Section 5.4). The identity stat leaves the data unchanged. Multiple bars in the same location will be stacked on top of one another.\n\n    -   `geom_line()` makes a line plot. The group aesthetic determines which observations are connected; see Chapter 4 for more detail. geom_line() connects points from left to right; geom_path() is similar but connects points in the order they appear in the data. Both geom_line() and geom_path() also understand the aesthetic linetype, which maps a categorical variable to solid, dotted and dashed lines.\n\n    -   `geom_point()` produces a scatterplot. geom_point() also understands the shape aesthetic.\n\n    -   `geom_polygon()` draws polygons, which are filled paths. Each vertex of the polygon requires a separate row in the data. It is often useful to merge a data frame of polygon coordinates with the data just prior to plotting. Chapter 6 illustrates this concept in more detail for map data.\n\n    -   `geom_rect()`, `geom_tile()` and `geom_raster()` draw rectangles. `geom_rect()` is parameterised by the four corners of the rectangle, xmin, ymin, xmax and ymax. `geom_tile()` is exactly the same, but parameterised by the center of the rect and its size, x, y, width and height. `geom_raster()` is a fast special case of `geom_tile()` used when all the tiles are the same size. .\n\n    -   `geom_text()` adds text to a plot. It requires a label aesthetic that provides the text to display, and has a number of parameters (angle, family, fontface, hjust and vjust) that control the appearance of the text.\n\n[^3]: [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis (3e) Chapter 3](https://ggplot2-book.org/individual-geoms)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-nrow=\"4\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\ndf <- data.frame(\n  x = c(3, 1, 5), \n  y = c(2, 4, 6), \n  label = c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\")\n)\np <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y, label = label)) + \n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) + # Hide axis label\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 15)) # Shrink plot title\np + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"geom_point\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\np + geom_text() + ggtitle(\"geom_text\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\np + geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") + ggtitle(\"geom_bar\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\np + geom_tile() + ggtitle(\"geom_raster\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-4.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\np + geom_line() + ggtitle(\"geom_line\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-5.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\np + geom_area() + ggtitle(\"geom_area\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-6.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\np + geom_path() + ggtitle(\"geom_path\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-7.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\np + geom_polygon() + ggtitle(\"geom_polygon\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-8.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Aesthetics: Changing how geometries look like\n\nWe can change more *details* about how geometries look like in several ways, for example their transparency, color, size, shape, etc.\n\nIn R, we added more arguments into the `geom_point` function, like `geom_point(color = \"red\")`\n\nTo know which *aesthetic* components can be changed in a particular geometry, look at its documentation (e.g. `?geom_point`) and look under the \"Aesthetics\" section of the help page.\n\n-   For example,\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## the documentation for `?geom_point` says:\n\n-   geom_point() understands the following aesthetics (required aesthetics are in bold):\n    -   **x**\n    -   **y**\n    -   alpha\n    -   color\n    -   fill\n    -   group\n    -   shape\n    -   size\n    -   stroke\n:::\n\n---\n\n- For example, we can change the transparency of the points in our scatterplot using `alpha` argument in `geom_point()` (`alpha` varies between 0-1 with zero being transparent and 1 being opaque):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = gapminder2010, \n       mapping = aes(x = children_per_woman, \n                     y = life_expectancy)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) # <4>\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.

We will see how to solve this later.\n:::::\n\n## Multiple Geometries\n\nOften, we may want to overlay several geometries on top of each other. For example, add a [violin plot](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/violin.html) together with a boxplot so that we get both representations of the data in a single graph.\n\n1.  Let's start by making a violin plot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# scale the violins by \"width\" rather than \"area\", which is the default\nggplot(gapminder2010, aes(x = world_region, \n                          y = children_per_woman)) +\n  geom_violin(scale = \"width\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> The shape represents the density estimate of the variable: the more data points in a specific range, the larger the violin is for that range.\n\n---\n\n2.

To layer an \"extra\" boxplot on top of it we \"add\" (with `+`) another geometry to the graph:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Make boxplots thinner so the shape of the violins is visible\nggplot(gapminder2010, aes(x = world_region, y = children_per_woman)) +\n  geom_violin(scale = \"width\") +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2) +\n  coord_flip()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n::: callout-note\nThe order in which you add the geometries defines the order they are \"drawn\" on the graph.

If we switch the order of \"boxplot\" and \"violin\". Boxplot is overlapped by violin plot.\n\nNotice how we've shortened our code by omitting the names of the options `data = gapminder2010` and `mapping = aes(...)` inside `ggplot()`. Because [[the data is always the first thing in the first place]{.underline}]{style=\"color:tomato\"} given to `ggplot()` and the mapping is always identified by the function `aes()`, this is often written in the more compact form as we just did.\n:::\n\n## Controlling aesthetics in individual geometries\n\nLet's say that, in the graph above, we wanted to color the violins by world region, but keep the boxplots without color.\n\nAs we've learned, because we want to color our geometries *based on data*, this goes inside the `aes()` part of the graph:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# use the `fill` aesthetic, which colors the **inside** of the geometry\nggplot(gapminder2010, aes(x = world_region, \n                          y = children_per_woman, \n                          fill = world_region)) +\n  geom_violin(scale = \"width\") +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n::: callout-important\n## What if we want only violin plot to be colored not the boxplot\n\nOK, this is not what we wanted. Both *geometries* (boxplots and violins) got colored.\n\nIt turns out that we can control aesthetics individually in each geometry, by puting the `aes()` inside the geometry function itself. Like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(gapminder2010, aes(x = world_region, \n                          y = children_per_woman)) + #<1>\n  geom_violin(aes(fill = world_region), scale = \"width\") + #<2>\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.  Notice that we remove the coloring syntax, `aes(fill = world_region)`, from `ggplot` which applies to all geometries - violine and boxplot\n2.  Note that we add another `aes` inside `geom_violin` geometry, which specify violin\n:::\n\n---\n\n## Exercise-04\n\n:::: {.panel-tabset}\n## Exercise\n\n-   Modify the graph above by coloring the inside of the boxplots by world region and the inside of the violins in grey color (hint: think about inside or outside `aes` for grey color. The code name for grey color in R is `\"grey\"`).\n\n## Solution\n\nBecause we want to define the fill color of the violin \"manually\" it goes *outside* `aes()`. Whereas for the violin we want the fill to depend on a column of data, so it goes inside `aes()`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(gapminder2010, aes(x = world_region, y = children_per_woman)) +\n  geom_violin(fill = \"grey\", scale = \"width\") +\n  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = world_region), width = 0.2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough this graph looks appealing, the color is redundant with the x-axis labels. So, the same information is being shown with multiple *aesthetics*. This is not necessarily incorrect, but we should generally [avoid too much gratuitous use of color in graphs](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/color-pitfalls.html). At the very least we should remove the legend from this graph.\n::::\n\n## Facets\n\nYou can split your plot into multiple panels by using *facetting*. There are two types of *facet* functions:\n\n-   `facet_wrap()` arranges a one-dimensional sequence of panels to fit on one page.\n-   `facet_grid()` allows you to form a matrix of rows and columns of panels.\n\nInside `facet_<type>` function, we assign a **faceting variable** which is basically a group variable with muliple levels with each level will be a panel plot.\n\n::: callout-tip\nFor example, `facet_wrap(vars(gender))` with `gender` has two levels: male/female. Then it will output two panels of plots (left: male, right: female).\n:::\n\nBoth geometries allow to to specify faceting variables specified with `vars()`. In general:\n\n-   `facet_wrap(facets = vars(facet_variable))`\n-   `facet_grid(rows = vars(row_variable), cols = vars(col_variable))`.\n\n\n---\n\n- For example, if we want to visualize the scatterplot above split by `income_groups`:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(gapminder2010, \n       aes(x = children_per_woman, \n           y = life_expectancy, \n           color = world_region)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(facets = vars(income_groups))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n- If instead we want a *matrix* of facets to display `income_groups` and `economic_organisation`, then we use `facet_grid()`:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(gapminder2010, \n       aes(x = children_per_woman, \n           y = life_expectancy, \n           color = world_region)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_grid(rows = vars(income_groups), \n             cols = vars(is_oecd))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n- Finally, with `facet_grid()`, you can organise the panels just by rows or just by columns. Try running this code yourself:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin layout-ncol=\"1\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# One column, facet by rows\nggplot(gapminder2010, \n       aes(x = children_per_woman, y = life_expectancy, color = world_region)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_grid(rows = vars(is_oecd))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# One row, facet by column\nggplot(gapminder2010, \n       aes(x = children_per_woman, y = life_expectancy, color = world_region)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_grid(cols = vars(is_oecd))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Modifying scales\n\nOften you want to change how the scales of your plot are defined. For example, we want to change the default color scheme from \"red/yellow/green\" to \"black/dark grey/grey\".\n\nIn `ggplot2` scales can refer to the *x* and *y* aesthetics, but also to other aesthetics such as *color*, *shape*, *fill*, etc.\n\nWe modify scales using the *scale* family of functions. These functions always follow the following naming convention: `scale_<aesthetic>_<type>`, where:\n\n-   `<aesthetic>` refers to the aesthetic for that scale function (e.g. `x`, `y`, `color`, `fill`, `shape`, etc.)\n-   `<type>` refers to the type of aesthetic (e.g. `discrete`, `continuous`, `manual`)\n\nLet's see some examples.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Change a numerical axis scale\n\nTaking the graph from the previous exercise we can modify the x and y axis scales, for example to emphasis a particular range of the data and define the breaks of the axis ticks.\n\n-   `limits =` with a vector with the length as 2 set the lower and upper limits of x or y axis.\n\n-   `breaks =` with `seq(0, 3, by = 1)` sets the x-axis ticks at the points of 0, 1, 2, 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Emphasise countries with 1-3 children and > 70 years life expectancy\nggplot(gapminder2010, \n       aes(x = children_per_woman, y = life_expectancy)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 3), breaks = seq(0, 3, by = 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(70, 85))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nYou can also apply transformations to the data.

One common data transformation to solve this issue is to log-transform our values.

That's because our data is now plotted on a log-scale.\n\nYou could transform the data directly in the variable given to x:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(gapminder2010, aes(x = log10(income_per_person))) +\n  geom_histogram()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is also fine, but in this case the x-axis scale would show you the log-transformed values, rather than the original values.

To transform the scale, we can use `scale_size_continuous()`:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = gapminder2010, \n       mapping = aes(x = children_per_woman, y = life_expectancy)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = world_region, size = population)) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  scale_size_continuous(trans = \"log10\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ESRM6990V_Lecture08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-44-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n::::\n\n## Saving graphs\n\nTo save a graph, you can use the `ggsave()` function, which needs two pieces of information:\n\n-   The *filename* where it will save the graph to. The extension of this filename will determine the format of the file (e.g. `.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpeg`).\n-   The *plot* you want to save. This can either be an object with a ggplot or, if not specified, it will be the last plot on your plotting window.\n\nYou can also specify options for the size of the graph and dpi (for PNG or JPEG).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# save the plot stored in our \"p\" object as a PDF\n# it will be 15cm x 7cm (default units is inches)\nggsave(filename = \"figures/fertility_vs_life_expectancy.pdf\",\n       plot = p, \n       width = 15, \n       height = 7, \n       units = \"cm\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother easy way to save your graphs is by using RStudio's interface. From the \"Plots\" panel there is an option to \"Export\" the graph. However, doing it with code like above ensures reproducibility, and will allow you to track which files where generated from which script.\n\n## Customising your graphs\n\n-   Every single element of a ggplot can be modified. This is further covered in a future episode.\n\n-   For some simple plot, like the density plot of single variable, you may not need `ggplot2` package. Base R has some built-in plotting function for data visualization. See this [blog](https://intro2r.com/simple-base-r-plots.html) for example.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Summary\n\n::: callout-note\n## Data Tip: visualizing data\n\n1.  Data visualization is one of the fundamental elements of data analysis. It allows you to assess variation within variables and relationships between variables.\n\n2.  Choosing the right type of graph to answer particular questions (or convey a particular message) can be daunting. The [data-to-viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) website can be a great place to get inspiration from.\n\n3.  Here are some common types of graph you may want to do for particular situations:\n\n    -   Look at variation within a single variable using *histograms* (`geom_histogram()`) or, less commonly (but [quite useful](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/stat_ecdf.html#ref-examples)) *empirical cumulative density function* plots (`stat_ecdf`).\n\n    -   Look at variation of a variable across categorical groups using *boxplots* (`geom_boxplot()`), *violin plots* (`geom_violin()`) or *frequency* polygons (`geom_freqpoly()`).\n\n    -   Look at the relationship between two numeric variables using *scatterplots* (`geom_point()`).\n\n    -   If your x-axis is ordered (e.g. year) use a line plot (`geom_line()`) to convey the change on your y-variable.\n:::\n",
