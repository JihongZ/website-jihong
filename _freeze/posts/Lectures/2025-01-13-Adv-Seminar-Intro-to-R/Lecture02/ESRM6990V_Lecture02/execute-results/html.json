The information that we can create/change/remove is called R **object**.\n\n-   Suppose we want to solve several quadratic equations of the form $x^2 + x - 1 = 0$. We know that the quadratic formula gives us the solutions:\n\n    $$\n    \\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2 -4ac}}{2a}\n    $$\n\n-   The solution depend on the values of a, b, and c. One advantage of programming languages is that we can **define** variables and **write** expressions with these variables\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    coef_a <- 1\n    coef_b <- 1\n    coef_c <- -1\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n-   We use `<-` to **assign** values to the variables. We can also assign values using `=` instead of `<-`, but we recommend against using `=` to avoid confusion.\n\n-   To **see** the value stored in a variable, we simply ask R to evaluate `coef_a` and it shows the stored value:\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    coef_a\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n    [1] 1\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n    -   A more explicit way to ask R to show us the value stored in `coef_a` is using `print` function like this (`print` is a prebuilt function in R, we will explain later):\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    print(coef_a)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n    [1] 1\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n## Workspace\n\n-   So we have object, then where they are stored in R. The workspace is the place storing the objects we can use:\n\n-   You can see all the variables saved in your workspace by typing:\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    ls()\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n    [1] \"coef_a\" \"coef_b\" \"coef_c\"\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n-   In RStudio, the *Environment* tab shows the values:\n\n    ![](https://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/dsbook-part-1/R/img/rstudio-environment.png)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   We should see `coef_a`, `coef_b`, and `coef_c`.\n\n-   **Missing R object in workspace**: If you try to recover the value of a variable that is not in your workspace, you receive an error. For example, if you type `some_random_object` you will receive the following message: `Error: object 'some_random_object' not found`.\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    print(some_random_object)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n    \n    ```\n    Error in print(some_random_object): object 'some_random_object' not found\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n-   Now since these values are saved in variables, to obtain a solution to our equation, we use the quadratic formula:\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    (-coef_b + sqrt(coef_b^2 - 4*coef_a*coef_c))/(2*coef_a)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n    [1] 0.618034\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    (-coef_b - sqrt(coef_b^2 - 4*coef_a*coef_c))/(2*coef_a)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n    [1] -1.618034\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## Operators\n\n-   `-`: is a negative operator which switches the sign of object\n\n-   `+` and `*` and `/` : addition, multiplication, and division\n\n-   `sqrt`: a prebuilt R function of calculating the squared root of the object\n\n-   `^`: exponent operator to calculate the \"power\" of the \"base\"; `a^3` : a to the 3rd power\n:::\n\n## Prebuilt functions\n\n-   **Functions**: Once we defined the objects, the data analysis process can usually be described as [a series of *functions*]{.underline} applied to the data.\n\n    -   In other words, we considered \"function\" as a set of pre-specified operations (e.g., macro in SAS)\n\n    -   R includes several **predefined functions** and most of the analysis pipelines we construct make extensive use of these.\n\n    -   We already used or discussed the `install.packages`, `library`, and `ls` functions. We also used the function `sqrt` to solve the quadratic equation above.\n\n-   **Evaluation**: In general, we need to use parentheses followed by a function name to evaluate a function.\n\n    -   If you type `ls`, the function is not evaluated and instead R shows you the code that defines the function. If you type [`ls()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/ls.html) the function is evaluated and, as seen above, we see objects in the workspace.\n\n-   **Function Arguments:** Unlike `ls`, most functions require one or more *arguments* to specify the settings of the function.\n\n    -   For example, we assign different object to the argument of the function `log`. Remember that we earlier defined `coef_a` to be 1:\n\n\n\n\n        ::: {.cell}\n        \n        ```{.r .cell-code}\n        log(8)\n        ```\n        \n        ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n        \n        ```\n        [1] 2.079442\n        ```\n        \n        \n        :::\n        \n        ```{.r .cell-code}\n        log(coef_a) \n        ```\n        \n        ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n        \n        ```\n        [1] 0\n        ```\n        \n        \n        :::\n        :::\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   **Help**: You can find out what the function expects and what it does by reviewing the very useful manuals included in R. You can get help by using the `help` function like this:\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    help(\"log\")\n    ?log\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n    -   The help page will show you what arguments the function is expecting. For example, `log` needs `x` and `base` to run.\n\n    -   The base of the function `log` defaults to `base = exp(1)` making `log` the natural log by default.\n\n        ![](images/clipboard-1863636552.png)\n\n    -   You can also use `args` to look at the arguments\n\n\n\n\n        ::: {.cell}\n        \n        ```{.r .cell-code}\n        args(log)\n        ```\n        \n        ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n        \n        ```\n        function (x, base = exp(1)) \n        NULL\n        ```\n        \n        \n        :::\n        \n        ```{.r .cell-code}\n        log(x = 8, base = 2)\n        ```\n        \n        ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n        \n        ```\n        [1] 3\n        ```\n        \n        \n        :::\n        :::\n\n\n\n\n    -   If specifying [the arguments’ names]{.underline}, then we can include them in whatever order we want:\n\n\n\n\n        ::: {.cell}\n        \n        ```{.r .cell-code}\n        log(base = 2, x = 8)\n        ```\n        \n        ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n        \n        ```\n        [1] 3\n        ```\n        \n        \n        :::\n        :::\n\n\n\n\n## Prebuilt objects\n\n-   There are several datasets or values that are included for users to practice and test out functions. For example, you can use $\\pi$ in your calculation directly:\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    pi\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n    [1] 3.141593\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n-   Or infinity value $\\infty$:\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    Inf + 1\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n    [1] Inf\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n-   You can see all the available datasets by typing:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   For example, if you type `iris`, it will output the famous (Fisher's or Anderson's) iris data set gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width:\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    iris\n    ?iris\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n    You can check the detailed help page of `iris` using `?` as we did for functions.\n\n## Variable Names\n\n-   When writing code in R, it’s important to choose variable names that are both **meaningful** and **avoid conflicts with existing functions** or reserved words in the language.\n\n    -   For example, avoid using `c` as variable name because R has a existing prebuilt function `c()`:\n\n\n\n\n        ::: {.cell}\n        \n        ```{.r .cell-code}\n        c(1, 2)\n        ```\n        \n        ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n        \n        ```\n        [1] 1 2\n        ```\n        \n        \n        :::\n        :::\n\n\n\n\n-   Some basic rules in R are that variable names have to **start with a letter**, **can’t contain spaces**, and **should not be variables that are predefined** in R, such as `c`.\n\n-   A nice convention to follow is to use meaningful words that describe what is stored, use only lower case, and use underscores as a substitute for spaces.\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    r_1 <- (-coef_b + sqrt(coef_b^2 - 4*coef_a*coef_c))/(2*coef_a)\n    r_2 <- (-coef_b - sqrt(coef_b^2 - 4*coef_a*coef_c))/(2*coef_a)\n    r_1\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n    [1] 0.618034\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    r_2\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n    [1] -1.618034\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n## Saving workspace\n\n-   Objects and functions remain in the workspace until you end your session or erase them with the function `rm`.\n\n-   **Autosave**: Your current workspaces also can be saved for later use.\n\n    -   In fact, when you quit R, Rstudio asks you if you want to save your workspace as `.RData`. If you do save it, the next time you start R, the program will restore the workspace.\n\n-   **ManualSave**: We actually recommend against saving the workspace this way because, as you start working on different projects, it will become harder to keep track of what is saved.\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    save(file = \"project_lecture_2.RData\") # Save Workspace as project_lecture_2.RData\n    load(\"project_lecture_2.RData\") # Load Workspace\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n## Commenting your code\n\n-   If a line of R code starts with the symbol `#`, it is a comment and is not evaluated.\n\n    -   We can use this to write reminders of why we wrote particular code:\n\n\n\n\n        ::: {.cell}\n        \n        ```{.r .cell-code}\n        ## Code to compute solution to quadratic equation\n        \n        ## Define the variables\n        coef_a <- 3 \n        coef_b <- 2\n        coef_c <- -1\n        \n        ## Now compute the solution\n        (-coef_b + sqrt(coef_b^2 - 4*coef_a*coef_c))/(2*coef_a)\n        ```\n        \n        ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n        \n        ```\n        [1] 0.3333333\n        ```\n        \n        \n        :::\n        \n        ```{.r .cell-code}\n        (-coef_b - sqrt(coef_b^2 - 4*coef_a*coef_c))/(2*coef_a)\n        ```\n        \n        ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n        \n        ```\n        [1] -1\n        ```\n        \n        \n        :::\n        :::\n\n\n\n\n# Exercises (30 minutes)\n\n1.  What is the sum of the first 100 positive integers? The formula for the sum of integers 1 through n is $n(n+1)/2$. Define\n\n    $n=100$ and then use R to compute the sum of 1 through 100 using the formula. What is the sum?\n\n2.  Now use the same formula to compute the sum of the integers from 1 through 1000.\n\n3.  Look at the result of typing the following code into R:\n\n    -   Based on the result, what do you think the functions `seq` and `sum` do? You can use help.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn <- 1000 \nx <- seq(1, n) \nsum(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 500500\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n4.  In math and programming, we say that we evaluate a function when we replace the argument with a given value. So if we type `sqrt(4)`, we evaluate the `sqrt` function. In R, you can evaluate a function inside another function. The evaluations happen from the inside out. Use one line of code to compute the log, in base 10, of the square root of 100.\n\n5.  Which of the following will always return the numeric value stored in x?
