Understand the relationship between Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis\n\n2.  Understand what is network analysis and confirmatory factor analysis\n\n3.  Understand the relationship between psychometric/psychological network with factor analysis\n\n4.  Understand how network model can be applied into real scenarios\n\n# Confirmatory Factor Analysis\n\n## CFA Approach to EFA\n\n-   EFA and CFA are same things except that one is to explore the factor structure (EFA) and one is to confirm pre-determined factor structure (CFA).\n\n-   But ... we can also conduct **exploratory analysis** using a CFA model\n\n    -   Need to set the right number of constraints for identification\n    -   We set the value of factor loadings for a few items on a few of the factors\n        -   Typically to zero\n        -   Sometimes to one (Brown, 2002)\n    -   We keep the factor covariance matrix as an identity\n        -   Uncorrelated factors (as in EFA) with variances of one\n\n-   Benefits of using CFA for exploratory analyses:\n\n-   CFA constraints remove rotational indeterminacy of factor loadings – no rotating is needed (or possible)\n\n    -   Defines factors with potentially less ambiguity\n    -   Constraints are easy to see\n\n-   For some software (SAS and SPSS), we get much more model fit information\n\n## Example of CFA\n\nSee the [example](https://www.lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/cfa.html) from lavaan package\n\n# Background\n\n## Network Analysis\n\nNetwork analysis is a broad area. It has many names in varied fields:\n\n1.  Graphical Models (Computer Science, Machine Learning)\n2.  Bayesian Network (Computer Science, Educational Measurement)\n3.  Social Network (Sociology)\n4.  Psychological/Psychometric Network (Psychopathology, Psychology)\n5.  Structural Equation Model, Path Analysis (Psychology, Education)\n\n1 and 2 focus on the probabilistic relationships and further casual relationships among variables. 3 and 4 focuses on network structure and node importance. 5 focus on the regression coefficients of structural and measurement model.\n\nAll 5 analysis methods have a network-shaped diagram. [**Graphical modeling**]{.underline} is a more \"general\" term that can comprise of the other network models.\n\n## Examples of Varied Networks\n\n::: {layout=\"[[40,40], [100]]\" layout-halign=\"bottom\"}\n![Bayesian Network (Briganti et al., 2023)](/posts/Lectures/2024-01-12-syllabus-adv-multivariate-esrm-6553/Images/Lecture12_Network/BN_DAG.png){#fig-BN-DAG}\n\n![Facebook friendship network in a single undergraduate dorm (Lewis et al., 2008)](/posts/Lectures/2024-01-12-syllabus-adv-multivariate-esrm-6553/Images/Lecture12_Network/SocialNetwork.png){#fig-social-network}\n\n![Factor Analysis and Psychological Network (Borsboom et al., 2021)](/posts/Lectures/2024-01-12-syllabus-adv-multivariate-esrm-6553/Images/Lecture12_Network/GGM.png){#fig-GGM}\n:::\n\n## Research Aims\n\n1.  Bayesian Network (BN) aims to derive the casual relations between variables\n2.  Social Network aims to examine the network structure (community, density or centrality) of [individuals]{.underline}\n3.  Factor Analysis aims to identify latent variables\n4.  Psychological Network aims to examines the associations among observed variables (topological structures) and their positions in the network.\n\n## Network Psychometrics\n\n1.  Network psychometrics is a novel area that allows representing complex phenomena of measured constructs in terms of a set of elements that interact with each other.\n2.  It is inspired by the so-called [mutualism model]{.underline} and research in ecosystem modeling [@kan2019].\n    -   A mutualism model proposes that basic cognitive abilities directly and positively interact during development.\n3.  Psychometric network arises as [dynamics or reciprocal causation]{.underline} among variables are getting more attentions.\n4.  For example, individual differences in depression could arise from, and could be maintained by, vicious cycles of mutual relationships among symptoms.\n5.  A depression symptom such as insomnia can cause another symptom, such as fatigue, which in turn can determine concentration problems and worrying, which can result in more insomnia and so on.\n\n## Comparison to factor analysis\n\n[**Factor analysis**]{.underline} (common factor model) assumes the associations between observed features can be explained by one or more common factors.\n\n-   For example, higher \"depression\" level leads to increased frequency of depressive behaviors\n\n[**Psychometric network**]{.underline}, however, assumes the associations between observed features ARE the reason of the development of depression. Or \"depression\" is the network itself.\n\n-   unavoidable cycle of \"fatigue -\\> worrying -\\> insomnia -\\> fatigue\" will leads to higher \"depression\"\n\n## Utility of Psychometric Network\n\n1.  Explain the pathways of certain psychological phenomenon\n2.  Identify the most important problem that needed to be intervene in the treatment procedure\n3.  Examine group differences in interactions among observed features\n4.  Examine density of network: more dense network indicates more dynamic of certain problems\n5.  Examine clusters/communities of observed features: some symptoms are more likely to concur than other symptoms\n\n## Terminology I - Overall procedure\n\n1.  [Network structure estimation]{.underline}: the application of statistical models to assess the structure of pairwise (conditional) associations in multivariate data.\n2.  [Network description]{.underline}: characterization of the global topology and the position of individual nodes in that topology.\n3.  [Psychometric network analysis]{.underline}: the analysis of multivariate psychometric data using network structure estimation and network description.\n\n## Terminology II - Network description\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n1.  [Node]{.underline}: psychometric variables that are selected in the network\n    -   such as responses to questionnaire items, symptom ratings, and cognitive test scores, background variables such as age and gender, experimental interventions.\n2.  [Edge (conditional association)]{.underline}: associations between variables taking into account other variables that may explain the association\n3.  [Edge weight]{.underline}: parameter estimates that represent the strength of conditional association between nodes\n4.  [Node centrality]{.underline}: the relative importance of a node in the context of other nodes, that can be calculated using different statistics\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](/posts/Lectures/2024-01-12-syllabus-adv-multivariate-esrm-6553/Images/Lecture12_Network/girls_contemporaneous_MG.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n## Terminology III - Network structure estimation\n\n1.  [Node selection]{.underline}: the choice of which variables will function as nodes in the network model.\n2.  [Network stability analysis]{.underline}: the assessment of estimation precision and robustness to sampling error of psychometric networks.\n3.  [Pairwise Markov random field (PMRF)]{.underline}: an undirected network that represents variables as nodes and conditional associations as edges, in which unconnected nodes are conditionally independent.\n\n## Exploratory Nature\n\nPsychometric network is exploratory by nature. To obtain a meaningful network structure, psychometric networks need to drop weak edges but keep strong edges.\n\nThis procedure is typically called edge selection. One popular edge selection method is [regularization]{.underline}.\n\n-   Original network structure without regularization is called saturated network; vice versa regularized network\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![Emotion regulation (Awareness), Interpersonal problems and eating disorder](/posts/Lectures/2024-01-12-syllabus-adv-multivariate-esrm-6553/Images/Lecture12_Network/girls_betweensubject_MG.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](/posts/Lectures/2024-01-12-syllabus-adv-multivariate-esrm-6553/Images/Lecture12_Network/girls_contemporaneous_MG.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n## Workflow of psychometric network\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n![](/posts/Lectures/2024-01-12-syllabus-adv-multivariate-esrm-6553/Images/Lecture12_Network/workflow.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\nPsychometric network analysis methodology includes steps of network structure estimation (to construct the network), network description (to characterize the network) and network stability analysis (to assess the robustness of results).\n:::\n:::\n\n## Types of data and network models\n\n1.  Cross-sectional data (N = large, T = 1)\n    -   **Ising** model for categorical variables\n    -   Gaussian graphical model (**GGM**; Foygel & Drton, 2010) for continuous variables\n    -   Mixed graphical model (**MGM**) for mixed types of variables: include both categorical variables and continuous variables\n2.  Panel data (N \\>\\> T)\n    -   Multilevel Graphical vector autoregressive model (**GVAR**)\n        -   i.e., longitudinal data, repeated measures\n3.  Time-series data ($N \\geq 1$, T = large)\n    -   Graphical vector autoregression\n        -   i.e., ecological momentary assessment, conducted via smartphones\n\n# Network Estimation\n\n## Gaussian graphical model\n\nGGM is one type of Pairwise Markov random field (PMRF) when data are continuous.\n\nIn a PMRF, the joint likelihood of multivariate data is modeled through the use of pairwise conditional associations, leading to a network representation that is undirected.\n\nFor $p$-dimensional data following multivariate normal distribution:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{X} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\boldsymbol{K}^{-1})\n$$\n\nWhere $K$ is a inverse covariance matrix of $\\boldsymbol{X}$ ($K = \\Sigma^{-1}$), also known as *precision*/*concentration* matrix.\n\nTo obtain sparse network structure, the $i$th row and $j$th column element of $\\boldsymbol{K}$, $k_{ij}=0$ when edge $\\{j, k\\}$ is not included in the network $G$,\n\n-   It means $X^{(i)}$ and $X^{(j)}$ are independent conditional on the other variables .\n\n## Partial correlation networks\n\nGGM can be standardized as the partial correlation network, in which each edge of GGM representing partial correlations between two nodes.\n\n$$\n\\rho_{ij}=\\rho(X^{(i)}, X^{(j)}|\\boldsymbol{X}^{-(i,j)}) = -\\frac{k_{ij}}{\\sqrt{k_{ii}}\\sqrt{k_{jj}}}\n$$\n\nAssume there are three variables: fatigue, insomnia, concentration\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"True Covariance Matrix - $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$\"}\nSigma = matrix(c(\n  1,    -.26,  .31,\n  -.26,    1, -.08,\n  .31,  -.08,    1  \n), ncol = 3, byrow = T)\nSigma\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n      [,1]  [,2]  [,3]\n[1,]  1.00 -0.26  0.31\n[2,] -0.26  1.00 -0.08\n[3,]  0.31 -0.08  1.00\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"True Precision Matrix - K\"}\nK = solve(Sigma)\nround(K, 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n      [,1] [,2]  [,3]\n[1,]  1.18 0.28 -0.34\n[2,]  0.28 1.07  0.00\n[3,] -0.34 0.00  1.11\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"Partial correlation matrix - R\"}\nR = K\nfor (i in 1:nrow(R)) {\n  for (j in 1:ncol(R)){\n    if (i != j) {\n      R[i, j] = - K[i, j] / (sqrt(K[i, i])*sqrt(K[j, j]))\n    }else{\n      R[i, j] = 1\n    }\n  }\n}\nround(R, 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n      [,1]  [,2] [,3]\n[1,]  1.00 -0.25  0.3\n[2,] -0.25  1.00  0.0\n[3,]  0.30  0.00  1.0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Network Interpretation\n\n1.

Network-level metrics:\n    -   **Network stability**: The assessment of estimation precision and robustness to sampling error of psychometric networks. Assess whether edge weights and node centrality changes with case dropping subset bootstrap.\n    -   **Network sensitivity**: The sensitivity analysis of the network by adding covariates (age, gender, hukou, education, marital status, and self-rated health) to the model to control their confounding effects. Report whether some central nodes are no longer central after adding some variables.\n2.  Node-level metrics:\n    -   **Total number of node**\n    -   **Node centrality**: the position of individual nodes within the network. A generic term that subsumes a family of measures that aim to assess how central a node is in a network topology, such as node strength, betweenness and closeness.\n    -   **Node bridge strength**: the degree to which one node connects two nodes from different facets. The bridge nodes (nodes with high bridge strength) that connect different communities of nodes (e.g., Neurotic factors is bridge nodes between personality traits and depressive symptoms @liPersonalityTraitsDepressive2024).\n    -   **Node centrality differences between groups**: node A is central in group 1's network but not so central in group 2's network.\n3.  Edge-level metrics:\n    -   **Total Number of edges**: proportions of non-zero edges\n    -   **Edge weight**: edge weights typically are parameter estimates that represent the strength of the conditional association between nodes. **Average edge weight** can be used to assess the overall strength of network connections.\n\n# Example: Big Five Personality Scale\n\n## Data Information\n\n25 self-reported personality items representing 5 factors.\n\n70.6% edges are nonzero using EBICglasso, while only 63.6% edges are nonzero using BF method and 62.0% edges are kept using $\\alpha =.01$ significance testing\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"EBICglasso\"}\nlibrary(psych)\nlibrary(qgraph)\ndata(bfi)\nbig5groups <- list(\n  Agreeableness = 1:5,\n  Conscientiousness = 6:10,\n  Extraversion = 11:15,\n  Neuroticism = 16:20,\n  Openness = 21:25\n)\nCorMat <- cor_auto(bfi[,1:25])\n\nEBICgraph <- EBICglasso(CorMat, nrow(bfi), 0.5, threshold = TRUE)\n\n## density\ndensity_nonzero_edge <- function(pcor_matrix){\n  N_nonzero_edge = (sum(pcor_matrix == 0) - ncol(pcor_matrix)) /2\n  N_all_edge = ncol(pcor_matrix)*(ncol(pcor_matrix)-1)/2\n  N_nonzero_edge/N_all_edge\n}\ndensity_nonzero_edge(EBICgraph)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.7066667\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"Significance testing\"}\nPruneFit <- ggm(bfi[,1:25]) |> prune(alpha = .01)\ndensity_nonzero_edge(getmatrix(PruneFit, \"omega\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.62\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"Bayes Factor\"}\nBGGMfit <- BGGM::explore(bfi[,1:25], type = \"continuous\", iter = 1000, analytic = FALSE) |> \n  select()\ndensity_nonzero_edge(BGGMfit$pcor_mat_zero)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.6633333\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Network Structure\n\n::: {layout-nrow=\"2\"}\n::: column\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![EBICglasso](Lecture13_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n::: column\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Sig.
